DESCRIPTION
       Bash is an sh-compatible com‐
       mand   language   interpreter
       that  executes  commands read
       from the  standard  input  or
       from  a  file.  Bash also in‐
       corporates  useful   features
       from  the  Korn  and C shells
       (ksh and csh).

       Bash is intended to be a con‐
       formant implementation of the
       Shell and  Utilities  portion
       of  the IEEE POSIX specifica‐
       tion (IEEE Standard  1003.1).
       Bash  can be configured to be
       POSIX-conformant by default.

OPTIONS
       All of  the  single-character
       shell  options  documented in
       the description  of  the  set
       builtin   command,  including
       -o, can be  used  as  options
       when  the  shell  is invoked.
       In addition, bash  interprets
       the following options when it
       is invoked:

       -c        If the -c option is
                 present,  then com‐
                 mands are read from
                 the  first  non-op‐
                 tion  argument com‐
                 mand_string.     If
                 there are arguments
                 after    the   com‐
                 mand_string,    the
                 first  argument  is
                 assigned to $0  and
                 any remaining argu‐
                 ments  are assigned
                 to  the  positional
                 parameters.     The
                 assignment  to   $0
                 sets  the  name  of
                 the shell, which is
                 used in warning and
                 error messages.
       -i        If the -i option is
                 present, the  shell
                 is interactive.
       -l        Make bash act as if
                 it had been invoked
                 as  a  login  shell
                 (see INVOCATION be‐
                 low).
       -r        If the -r option is
                 present, the  shell
                 becomes  restricted
                 (see     RESTRICTED
                 SHELL below).
       -s        If the -s option is
                 present,  or  if no
                 arguments    remain
                 after  option  pro‐
                 cessing, then  com‐
                 mands are read from
                 the standard input.
                 This  option allows
                 the positional  pa‐
                 rameters  to be set
                 when  invoking   an
                 interactive   shell
                 or when reading in‐
                 put through a pipe.
       -v        Print  shell  input
                 lines  as  they are
                 read.
       -x        Print commands  and
                 their  arguments as
                 they are executed.
       -D        A list of all  dou‐
                 ble-quoted  strings
                 preceded  by  $  is
                 printed    on   the
                 standard    output.
                 These    are    the
                 strings  that   are
                 subject to language
                 translation    when
                 the current  locale
                 is  not C or POSIX.
                 This implies the -n
                 option; no commands
                 will be executed.
       [-+]O [shopt_option]
                 shopt_option is one
                 of  the  shell  op‐
                 tions  accepted  by
                 the  shopt  builtin
                 (see  SHELL BUILTIN
                 COMMANDS    below).
                 If  shopt_option is
                 present,  -O   sets
                 the  value  of that
                 option;  +O  unsets
                 it.   If  shopt_op‐
                 tion  is  not  sup‐
                 plied,   the  names
                 and values  of  the
                 shell  options  ac‐
                 cepted by shopt are
                 printed   on    the
                 standard    output.
                 If  the  invocation
                 option  is  +O, the
                 output is displayed
                 in  a  format  that
                 may  be  reused  as
                 input.
       --        A  --  signals  the
                 end  of options and
                 disables    further
                 option  processing.
                 Any arguments after
                 the -- are  treated
                 as   filenames  and
                 arguments.  An  ar‐
                 gument   of   -  is
                 equivalent to --.

       Bash also interprets a number
       of  multi-character  options.
       These  options must appear on
       the command line  before  the
       single-character  options  to
       be recognized.

       --debugger
              Arrange for the debug‐
              ger profile to be exe‐
              cuted before the shell
              starts.  Turns on  ex‐
              tended  debugging mode
              (see  the  description
              of the extdebug option
              to  the  shopt builtin
              below).
       --dump-po-strings
              Equivalent to -D,  but
              the  output  is in the
              GNU     gettext     po
              (portable object) file
              format.
       --dump-strings
              Equivalent to -D.
       --help Display  a  usage mes‐
              sage on standard  out‐
              put  and exit success‐
              fully.
       --init-file file
       --rcfile file
              Execute commands  from
              file  instead  of  the
              standard personal ini‐
              tialization       file
              ~/.bashrc if the shell
              is   interactive  (see
              INVOCATION     below).
              Note  that  the system
              wide    initialization
              file  /etc/bash.bashrc
              is still executed.

       --login
              Equivalent to -l.

       --noediting
              Do  not  use  the  GNU
              readline   library  to
              read   command   lines
              when  the shell is in‐
              teractive.

       --noprofile
              Do not read either the
              system-wide    startup
              file  /etc/profile  or
              any  of  the  personal
              initialization   files
              ~/.bash_profile,
              ~/.bash_login,      or
              ~/.profile.    By  de‐
              fault,   bash    reads
              these files when it is
              invoked   as  a  login
              shell (see  INVOCATION
              below).

       --norc Do  not  read and exe‐
              cute the  system  wide
              initialization    file
              /etc/bash.bashrc   and
              the  personal initial‐
              ization file ~/.bashrc
              if the shell is inter‐
              active.   This  option
              is  on  by  default if
              the shell  is  invoked
              as sh.

       --posix
              Change the behavior of
              bash where the default
              operation differs from
              the  POSIX standard to
              match   the   standard
              (posix mode).  See SEE
              ALSO  below for a ref‐
              erence to  a  document
              that details how posix
              mode   affects  bash's
              behavior.

       --restricted
              The shell becomes  re‐
              stricted    (see   RE‐
              STRICTED SHELL below).

       --verbose
              Equivalent to -v.

       --version
              Show version  informa‐
              tion for this instance
              of  bash  on the stan‐
              dard output  and  exit
              successfully.

ARGUMENTS
       If arguments remain after op‐
       tion  processing, and neither
       the -c nor the -s option  has
       been  supplied, the first ar‐
       gument is assumed to  be  the
       name  of  a  file  containing
       shell commands.  If  bash  is
       invoked  in  this fashion, $0
       is set to  the  name  of  the
       file,  and the positional pa‐
       rameters are set to  the  re‐
       maining    arguments.    Bash
       reads and  executes  commands
       from  this  file, then exits.
       Bash's  exit  status  is  the
       exit  status of the last com‐
       mand executed in the  script.
       If  no commands are executed,
       the exit status is 0.  An at‐
       tempt is first made  to  open
       the  file  in the current di‐
       rectory, and, if no  file  is
       found,    then    the   shell
       searches the  directories  in
       PATH for the script.

INVOCATION
       A  login  shell  is one whose
       first character  of  argument
       zero  is  a -, or one started
       with the --login option.

       An interactive shell  is  one
       started   without  non-option
       arguments (unless -s is spec‐
       ified) and without the -c op‐
       tion,  whose  standard  input
       and  error are both connected
       to terminals  (as  determined
       by isatty(3)), or one started
       with  the  -i option.  PS1 is
       set and $- includes i if bash
       is  interactive,  allowing  a
       shell  script  or  a  startup
       file to test this state.

       The following paragraphs  de‐
       scribe  how bash executes its
       startup files.  If any of the
       files  exist  but  cannot  be
       read,  bash reports an error.
       Tildes are expanded in  file‐
       names  as described below un‐
       der Tilde  Expansion  in  the
       EXPANSION section.

       When  bash  is  invoked as an
       interactive login  shell,  or
       as  a  non-interactive  shell
       with the --login  option,  it
       first reads and executes com‐
       mands from the file /etc/pro‐
       file,  if  that  file exists.
       After reading that  file,  it
       looks   for  ~/.bash_profile,
       ~/.bash_login,  and   ~/.pro‐
       file,   in  that  order,  and
       reads and  executes  commands
       from  the  first one that ex‐
       ists and  is  readable.   The
       --noprofile   option  may  be
       used  when   the   shell   is
       started  to  inhibit this be‐
       havior.

       When  an  interactive   login
       shell  exits, or a non-inter‐
       active login  shell  executes
       the   exit  builtin  command,
       bash reads and executes  com‐
       mands     from    the    file
       ~/.bash_logout, if it exists.

       When  an  interactive   shell
       that  is not a login shell is
       started, bash reads and  exe‐
       cutes      commands      from
       /etc/bash.bashrc          and
       ~/.bashrc, if these files ex‐
       ist.   This  may be inhibited
       by using the  --norc  option.
       The --rcfile file option will
       force  bash  to read and exe‐
       cute commands from  file  in‐
       stead   of  ~/.bashrc.   Note
       that  /etc/bash.bashrc   will
       still be read.

       When  bash is started non-in‐
       teractively, to run  a  shell
       script, for example, it looks
       for  the variable BASH_ENV in
       the environment, expands  its
       value  if  it  appears there,
       and uses the  expanded  value
       as the name of a file to read
       and execute.  Bash behaves as
       if the following command were
       executed:
              if [ -n "$BASH_ENV" ];
              then . "$BASH_ENV"; fi
       but  the  value  of  the PATH
       variable  is  not   used   to
       search for the filename.

       If  bash  is invoked with the
       name sh, it  tries  to  mimic
       the  startup behavior of his‐
       torical  versions  of  sh  as
       closely  as  possible,  while
       conforming to the POSIX stan‐
       dard as well.   When  invoked
       as   an   interactive   login
       shell, or  a  non-interactive
       shell  with  the  --login op‐
       tion, it  first  attempts  to
       read   and  execute  commands
       from /etc/profile and ~/.pro‐
       file,  in  that  order.   The
       --noprofile   option  may  be
       used to inhibit  this  behav‐
       ior.   When invoked as an in‐
       teractive shell with the name
       sh, bash looks for the  vari‐
       able  ENV,  expands its value
       if it is  defined,  and  uses
       the  expanded  value  as  the
       name of a file  to  read  and
       execute.   Since  a shell in‐
       voked as sh does not  attempt
       to  read and execute commands
       from any other startup files,
       the --rcfile  option  has  no
       effect.    A  non-interactive
       shell invoked with  the  name
       sh  does  not attempt to read
       any  other   startup   files.
       When  invoked as sh, bash en‐
       ters  posix  mode  after  the
       startup files are read.

       When bash is started in posix
       mode,  as  with  the  --posix
       command line option, it  fol‐
       lows  the  POSIX standard for
       startup files.  In this mode,
       interactive shells expand the
       ENV variable and commands are
       read and  executed  from  the
       file  whose  name  is the ex‐
       panded   value.    No   other
       startup files are read.

       Bash  attempts  to  determine
       when it is being run with its
       standard input connected to a
       network connection,  as  when
       executed  by  the  historical
       remote shell daemon,  usually
       rshd,  or  the  secure  shell
       daemon sshd.  If bash  deter‐
       mines it is being run non-in‐
       teractively  in this fashion,
       it reads  and  executes  com‐
       mands  from  /etc/bash.bashrc
       and ~/.bashrc, if these files
       exist and are  readable.   It
       will  not  do this if invoked
       as sh.  The --norc option may
       be used to inhibit  this  be‐
       havior,  and the --rcfile op‐
       tion may be used to force an‐
       other file to be read instead
       of  ~/.bashrc,  but   neither
       rshd  nor  sshd generally in‐
       voke the shell with those op‐
       tions or  allow  them  to  be
       specified.

       If  the shell is started with
       the effective user (group) id
       not equal to  the  real  user
       (group) id, and the -p option
       is  not  supplied, no startup
       files are read,  shell  func‐
       tions  are not inherited from
       the  environment,  the  SHEL‐
       LOPTS,  BASHOPTS, CDPATH, and
       GLOBIGNORE variables, if they
       appear  in  the  environment,
       are  ignored,  and the effec‐
       tive user id is  set  to  the
       real  user id.  If the -p op‐
       tion is supplied  at  invoca‐
       tion, the startup behavior is
       the  same,  but the effective
       user id is not reset.

DEFINITIONS
       The following definitions are
       used throughout the  rest  of
       this document.
       blank  A space or tab.
       word   A  sequence of charac‐
              ters considered  as  a
              single   unit  by  the
              shell.  Also known  as
              a token.
       name   A word consisting only
              of  alphanumeric char‐
              acters   and    under‐
              scores,  and beginning
              with   an   alphabetic
              character or an under‐
              score.   Also referred
              to as an identifier.
       metacharacter
              A character that, when
              unquoted,    separates
              words.    One  of  the
              following:
              |  & ; ( ) <  >  space
              tab newline
       control operator
              A  token that performs
              a  control   function.
              It  is one of the fol‐
              lowing symbols:
              || & && ; ;; ;& ;;&  (
              ) | |& <newline>

RESERVED WORDS
       Reserved words are words that
       have a special meaning to the
       shell.   The  following words
       are  recognized  as  reserved
       when  unquoted and either the
       first word of a command  (see
       SHELL   GRAMMAR  below),  the
       third word of a case  or  se‐
       lect   command  (only  in  is
       valid), or the third word  of
       a for command (only in and do
       are valid):

       !  case  coproc  do done elif
       else esac fi for function  if
       in  select then until while {
       } time [[ ]]

SHELL GRAMMAR
       This  section  describes  the
       syntax  of  the various forms
       of shell commands.

   Simple Commands
       A simple  command  is  a  se‐
       quence  of  optional variable
       assignments    followed    by
       blank-separated   words   and
       redirections, and  terminated
       by  a  control operator.  The
       first word specifies the com‐
       mand to be executed,  and  is
       passed as argument zero.  The
       remaining words are passed as
       arguments to the invoked com‐
       mand.

       The  return value of a simple
       command is its  exit  status,
       or  128+n  if  the command is
       terminated by signal n.

   Pipelines
       A pipeline is a  sequence  of
       one  or  more  commands sepa‐
       rated by one of  the  control
       operators  | or |&.  The for‐
       mat for a pipeline is:

              [time [-p]] [ ! ] com‐
              mand1  [  [|⎪|&]  com‐
              mand2 ... ]

       The  standard  output of com‐
       mand1 is connected via a pipe
       to the standard input of com‐
       mand2.   This  connection  is
       performed before any redirec‐
       tions  specified  by the com‐
       mand1(see REDIRECTION below).
       If  |&  is  used,  command1's
       standard  error,  in addition
       to its  standard  output,  is
       connected to command2's stan‐
       dard  input through the pipe;
       it is shorthand for  2>&1  |.
       This  implicit redirection of
       the  standard  error  to  the
       standard  output is performed
       after any redirections speci‐
       fied by command1.

       The  return   status   of   a
       pipeline  is  the exit status
       of the last  command,  unless
       the  pipefail  option  is en‐
       abled.  If  pipefail  is  en‐
       abled,  the pipeline's return
       status is the  value  of  the
       last  (rightmost)  command to
       exit with a non-zero  status,
       or  zero if all commands exit
       successfully.   If  the   re‐
       served  word  !   precedes  a
       pipeline, the exit status  of
       that  pipeline is the logical
       negation of the  exit  status
       as   described   above.   The
       shell waits for all  commands
       in  the pipeline to terminate
       before returning a value.

       If  the  time  reserved  word
       precedes   a   pipeline,  the
       elapsed as well as  user  and
       system  time  consumed by its
       execution are  reported  when
       the pipeline terminates.  The
       -p  option changes the output
       format to that  specified  by
       POSIX.   When the shell is in
       posix mode, it does not  rec‐
       ognize  time  as  a  reserved
       word if the next token begins
       with a `-'.   The  TIMEFORMAT
       variable may be set to a for‐
       mat string that specifies how
       the timing information should
       be  displayed;  see  the  de‐
       scription of TIMEFORMAT under
       Shell Variables below.

       When the shell  is  in  posix
       mode, time may be followed by
       a newline.  In this case, the
       shell displays the total user
       and  system  time consumed by
       the shell and  its  children.
       The  TIMEFORMAT  variable may
       be used to specify the format
       of the time information.

       Each command in a  multi-com‐
       mand  pipeline,  where  pipes
       are created, is executed in a
       subshell, which is a separate
       process.  See COMMAND  EXECU‐
       TION  ENVIRONMENT  for  a de‐
       scription of subshells and  a
       subshell environment.  If the
       lastpipe  option  is  enabled
       using the shopt builtin  (see
       the  description of shopt be‐
       low), the last element  of  a
       pipeline  may  be  run by the
       shell process when  job  con‐
       trol is not active.

   Lists
       A  list  is a sequence of one
       or more  pipelines  separated
       by one of the operators ;, &,
       &&,  or  ||,  and  optionally
       terminated by one of ;, &, or
       <newline>.

       Of these list  operators,  &&
       and || have equal precedence,
       followed  by  ;  and &, which
       have equal precedence.

       A sequence  of  one  or  more
       newlines may appear in a list
       instead of a semicolon to de‐
       limit commands.

       If a command is terminated by
       the  control  operator &, the
       shell executes the command in
       the background in a subshell.
       The shell does not  wait  for
       the  command  to  finish, and
       the  return  status   is   0.
       These   are  referred  to  as
       asynchronous commands.   Com‐
       mands  separated  by  a ; are
       executed  sequentially;   the
       shell  waits for each command
       to terminate  in  turn.   The
       return  status  is  the  exit
       status of  the  last  command
       executed.

       AND  and  OR  lists  are  se‐
       quences  of   one   or   more
       pipelines separated by the &&
       and || control operators, re‐
       spectively.  AND and OR lists
       are  executed with left asso‐
       ciativity.  An AND  list  has
       the form

              command1 && command2

       command2  is executed if, and
       only if, command1 returns  an
       exit  status  of  zero  (suc‐
       cess).

       An OR list has the form

              command1 || command2

       command2 is executed if,  and
       only  if,  command1 returns a
       non-zero  exit  status.   The
       return  status  of AND and OR
       lists is the exit  status  of
       the  last command executed in
       the list.

   Compound Commands
       A compound command is one  of
       the following.  In most cases
       a  list  in  a  command's de‐
       scription  may  be  separated
       from  the rest of the command
       by one or more newlines,  and
       may  be followed by a newline
       in place of a semicolon.

       (list) list is executed in  a
              subshell  (see COMMAND
              EXECUTION  ENVIRONMENT
              below  for  a descrip‐
              tion of a subshell en‐
              vironment).   Variable
              assignments        and
              builtin commands  that
              affect the shell's en‐
              vironment  do  not re‐
              main in  effect  after
              the command completes.
              The  return  status is
              the  exit  status   of
              list.

       { list; }
              list  is  simply  exe‐
              cuted in  the  current
              shell     environment.
              list  must  be  termi‐
              nated  with  a newline
              or semicolon.  This is
              known as a group  com‐
              mand.  The return sta‐
              tus is the exit status
              of  list.   Note  that
              unlike the metacharac‐
              ters ( and ), { and  }
              are reserved words and
              must occur where a re‐
              served word is permit‐
              ted  to be recognized.
              Since  they   do   not
              cause  a  word  break,
              they must be separated
              from  list  by  white‐
              space or another shell
              metacharacter.

       ((expression))
              The    expression   is
              evaluated according to
              the  rules   described
              below under ARITHMETIC
              EVALUATION.    If  the
              value of  the  expres‐
              sion  is non-zero, the
              return  status  is  0;
              otherwise  the  return
              status is 1.  The  ex‐
              pression undergoes the
              same  expansions as if
              it were within  double
              quotes,   but   double
              quote  characters   in
              expression   are   not
              treated specially  and
              are removed.

       [[ expression ]]
              Return  a  status of 0
              or 1 depending on  the
              evaluation of the con‐
              ditional    expression
              expression.    Expres‐
              sions  are composed of
              the   primaries    de‐
              scribed   below  under
              CONDITIONAL    EXPRES‐
              SIONS.   The words be‐
              tween the [[ and ]] do
              not    undergo    word
              splitting and pathname
              expansion.   The shell
              performs tilde  expan‐
              sion,   parameter  and
              variable    expansion,
              arithmetic  expansion,
              command  substitution,
              process  substitution,
              and quote  removal  on
              those  words  (the ex‐
              pansions  that   would
              occur   if  the  words
              were enclosed in  dou‐
              ble  quotes).   Condi‐
              tional operators  such
              as -f must be unquoted
              to  be  recognized  as
              primaries.

              When used with [[, the
              < and > operators sort
              lexicographically  us‐
              ing  the  current  lo‐
              cale.

       See the  description  of  the
       test builtin command (section
       SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below)
       for  the  handling of parame‐
       ters (i.e.   missing  parame‐
       ters).

       When  the == and != operators
       are used, the string  to  the
       right of the operator is con‐
       sidered a pattern and matched
       according  to  the  rules de‐
       scribed below  under  Pattern
       Matching,  as  if the extglob
       shell  option  were  enabled.
       The  = operator is equivalent
       to ==.   If  the  nocasematch
       shell  option is enabled, the
       match  is  performed  without
       regard  to the case of alpha‐
       betic characters.  The return
       value  is  0  if  the  string
       matches   (==)  or  does  not
       match (!=) the pattern, and 1
       otherwise.  Any part  of  the
       pattern   may  be  quoted  to
       force the quoted  portion  to
       be matched as a string.

       An  additional  binary opera‐
       tor, =~, is  available,  with
       the same precedence as == and
       !=.   When  it  is  used, the
       string to the  right  of  the
       operator   is   considered  a
       POSIX  extended  regular  ex‐
       pression  and matched accord‐
       ingly (using the  POSIX  reg‐
       comp  and  regexec interfaces
       usually     described      in
       regex(3)).   The return value
       is 0 if  the  string  matches
       the pattern, and 1 otherwise.
       If  the regular expression is
       syntactically incorrect,  the
       conditional  expression's re‐
       turn value is 2.  If the  no‐
       casematch shell option is en‐
       abled, the match is performed
       without regard to the case of
       alphabetic   characters.   If
       any part of  the  pattern  is
       quoted, the quoted portion is
       matched    literally.    This
       means every character in  the
       quoted  portion  matches  it‐
       self, instead of  having  any
       special    pattern   matching
       meaning.  If the  pattern  is
       stored  in  a shell variable,
       quoting the  variable  expan‐
       sion  forces  the entire pat‐
       tern to be matched literally.
       Treat bracket expressions  in
       regular   expressions   care‐
       fully, since  normal  quoting
       and  pattern  characters lose
       their meanings between brack‐
       ets.

       The pattern will match if  it
       matches   any   part  of  the
       string.  Anchor  the  pattern
       using the ^ and $ regular ex‐
       pression  operators  to force
       it  to   match   the   entire
       string.   The  array variable
       BASH_REMATCH  records   which
       parts  of  the string matched
       the pattern.  The element  of
       BASH_REMATCH   with  index  0
       contains the portion  of  the
       string  matching  the  entire
       regular   expression.    Sub‐
       strings  matched by parenthe‐
       sized  subexpressions  within
       the  regular  expression  are
       saved   in   the    remaining
       BASH_REMATCH indices. The el‐
       ement  of  BASH_REMATCH  with
       index n is the portion of the
       string   matching   the   nth
       parenthesized  subexpression.
       Bash sets BASH_REMATCH in the
       global scope; declaring it as
       a local variable will lead to
       unexpected results.

       Expressions may  be  combined
       using  the  following  opera‐
       tors,  listed  in  decreasing
       order of precedence:

              ( expression )
                     Returns     the
                     value  of   ex‐
                     pression.  This
                     may  be used to
                     override    the
                     normal   prece‐
                     dence of opera‐
                     tors.
              ! expression
                     True if expres‐
                     sion is false.
              expression1 && expres‐
              sion2
                     True  if   both
                     expression1 and
                     expression2 are
                     true.
              expression1 || expres‐
              sion2
                     True  if either
                     expression1  or
                     expression2  is
                     true.

              The && and  ||  opera‐
              tors  do  not evaluate
              expression2   if   the
              value  of  expression1
              is sufficient  to  de‐
              termine   the   return
              value  of  the  entire
              conditional    expres‐
              sion.

       for name [ [ in [ word ... ]
       ] ; ] do list ; done
              The list of words fol‐
              lowing in is expanded,
              generating a  list  of
              items.   The  variable
              name is  set  to  each
              element  of  this list
              in turn, and  list  is
              executed   each  time.
              If  the  in  word   is
              omitted,  the for com‐
              mand   executes   list
              once  for  each  posi‐
              tional parameter  that
              is set (see PARAMETERS
              below).    The  return
              status  is  the   exit
              status   of  the  last
              command that executes.
              If  the  expansion  of
              the items following in
              results  in  an  empty
              list, no commands  are
              executed,  and the re‐
              turn status is 0.

       for (( expr1 ; expr2 ; expr3
       )) ; do list ; done
              First, the  arithmetic
              expression   expr1  is
              evaluated according to
              the  rules   described
              below under ARITHMETIC
              EVALUATION.        The
              arithmetic  expression
              expr2  is  then evalu‐
              ated repeatedly  until
              it  evaluates to zero.
              Each time expr2 evalu‐
              ates  to  a   non-zero
              value,  list  is  exe‐
              cuted and  the  arith‐
              metic expression expr3
              is  evaluated.  If any
              expression is omitted,
              it behaves  as  if  it
              evaluates  to  1.  The
              return  value  is  the
              exit   status  of  the
              last command  in  list
              that  is  executed, or
              false if  any  of  the
              expressions   is   in‐
              valid.

       select name [ in word ] ; do
       list ; done
              The list of words fol‐
              lowing in is expanded,
              generating a  list  of
              items,  and the set of
              expanded   words    is
              printed  on  the stan‐
              dard error, each  pre‐
              ceded by a number.  If
              the  in  word is omit‐
              ted,  the   positional
              parameters are printed
              (see   PARAMETERS  be‐
              low).    select   then
              displays    the    PS3
              prompt  and  reads   a
              line from the standard
              input.   If  the  line
              consists of  a  number
              corresponding  to  one
              of    the    displayed
              words,  then the value
              of name is set to that
              word.  If the line  is
              empty,  the  words and
              prompt  are  displayed
              again.    If   EOF  is
              read, the select  com‐
              mand completes and re‐
              turns  1.   Any  other
              value read causes name
              to  be  set  to  null.
              The line read is saved
              in the variable REPLY.
              The  list  is executed
              after  each  selection
              until  a break command
              is executed.  The exit
              status  of  select  is
              the exit status of the
              last  command executed
              in list, or zero if no
              commands   were   exe‐
              cuted.

       case word in [ [(] pattern [
       | pattern ] ... ) list ;; ]
       ... esac
              A  case  command first
              expands   word,    and
              tries   to   match  it
              against  each  pattern
              in   turn,  using  the
              matching   rules   de‐
              scribed  under Pattern
              Matching  below.   The
              word is expanded using
              tilde expansion, para‐
              meter and variable ex‐
              pansion,    arithmetic
              expansion,     command
              substitution,  process
              substitution and quote
              removal.  Each pattern
              examined  is  expanded
              using tilde expansion,
              parameter and variable
              expansion,  arithmetic
              expansion,     command
              substitution,  process
              substitution,      and
              quote removal.  If the
              nocasematch  shell op‐
              tion is  enabled,  the
              match   is   performed
              without regard to  the
              case   of   alphabetic
              characters.   When   a
              match  is  found,  the
              corresponding list  is
              executed.   If  the ;;
              operator is  used,  no
              subsequent matches are
              attempted   after  the
              first  pattern  match.
              Using  ;&  in place of
              ;; causes execution to
              continue with the list
              associated  with   the
              next  set of patterns.
              Using ;;& in place  of
              ;; causes the shell to
              test  the next pattern
              list in the statement,
              if  any,  and  execute
              any associated list on
              a   successful  match,
              continuing  the   case
              statement execution as
              if  the  pattern  list
              had not matched.   The
              exit status is zero if
              no   pattern  matches.
              Otherwise, it  is  the
              exit   status  of  the
              last command  executed
              in list.

       if list; then list; [ elif
       list; then list; ] ... [ else
       list; ] fi
              The  if  list  is exe‐
              cuted.   If  its  exit
              status  is  zero,  the
              then list is executed.
              Otherwise,  each  elif
              list  is  executed  in
              turn, and if its  exit
              status  is  zero,  the
              corresponding     then
              list  is  executed and
              the command completes.
              Otherwise,  the   else
              list  is  executed, if
              present.    The   exit
              status   is  the  exit
              status  of  the   last
              command  executed,  or
              zero if  no  condition
              tested true.

       while list-1; do list-2; done
       until list-1; do list-2; done
              The while command con‐
              tinuously executes the
              list list-2 as long as
              the  last  command  in
              the  list  list-1  re‐
              turns  an  exit status
              of  zero.   The  until
              command  is  identical
              to the while  command,
              except  that  the test
              is negated: list-2  is
              executed  as  long  as
              the  last  command  in
              list-1  returns a non-
              zero exit status.  The
              exit  status  of   the
              while  and  until com‐
              mands is the exit sta‐
              tus of the  last  com‐
              mand    executed    in
              list-2,  or  zero   if
              none was executed.

   Coprocesses
       A  coprocess  is a shell com‐
       mand preceded by  the  coproc
       reserved  word.   A coprocess
       is executed asynchronously in
       a subshell, as if the command
       had been terminated with  the
       &  control  operator,  with a
       two-way pipe established  be‐
       tween the executing shell and
       the coprocess.

       The  syntax  for  a coprocess
       is:

              coproc [NAME]  command
              [redirections]

       This   creates   a  coprocess
       named NAME.  command  may  be
       either  a simple command or a
       compound command (see above).
       NAME  is  a  shell   variable
       name.   If  NAME  is not sup‐
       plied, the  default  name  is
       COPROC.

       The  recommended  form to use
       for a coprocess is

              coproc NAME {  command
              [redirections]; }

       This  form is recommended be‐
       cause simple commands  result
       in the coprocess always being
       named  COPROC, and it is sim‐
       pler to use and more complete
       than the other compound  com‐
       mands.

       If command is a compound com‐
       mand,  NAME  is optional. The
       word following coproc  deter‐
       mines  whether  that  word is
       interpreted  as  a   variable
       name:  it  is  interpreted as
       NAME if it is not a  reserved
       word  that  introduces a com‐
       pound command.  If command is
       a simple command, NAME is not
       allowed;  this  is  to  avoid
       confusion  between  NAME  and
       the first word of the  simple
       command.

       When  the  coprocess  is exe‐
       cuted, the shell  creates  an
       array  variable  (see  Arrays
       below) named NAME in the con‐
       text of the executing  shell.
       The  standard  output of com‐
       mand is connected via a  pipe
       to  a  file descriptor in the
       executing  shell,  and   that
       file  descriptor  is assigned
       to NAME[0].  The standard in‐
       put of command  is  connected
       via a pipe to a file descrip‐
       tor  in  the executing shell,
       and that file  descriptor  is
       assigned  to  NAME[1].   This
       pipe  is  established  before
       any redirections specified by
       the  command (see REDIRECTION
       below).  The file descriptors
       can be utilized as  arguments
       to  shell  commands and redi‐
       rections using standard  word
       expansions.  Other than those
       created  to  execute  command
       and  process   substitutions,
       the  file descriptors are not
       available in subshells.

       The process ID of  the  shell
       spawned  to  execute  the co‐
       process is available  as  the
       value    of    the   variable
       NAME_PID.  The  wait  builtin
       command  may  be used to wait
       for the coprocess  to  termi‐
       nate.

       Since  the  coprocess is cre‐
       ated as an asynchronous  com‐
       mand,  the coproc command al‐
       ways  returns  success.   The
       return  status of a coprocess
       is the exit  status  of  com‐
       mand.

   Shell Function Definitions
       A shell function is an object
       that  is called like a simple
       command and executes  a  com‐
       pound  command with a new set
       of   positional   parameters.
       Shell  functions are declared
       as follows:

       fname () compound-command
       [redirection]
       function fname [()] com‐
       pound-command [redirection]
              This defines  a  func‐
              tion named fname.  The
              reserved word function
              is  optional.   If the
              function reserved word
              is    supplied,    the
              parentheses   are  op‐
              tional.  The  body  of
              the  function  is  the
              compound command  com‐
              pound-command     (see
              Compound      Commands
              above).   That command
              is usually a  list  of
              commands between { and
              }, but may be any com‐
              mand listed under Com‐
              pound  Commands above.
              If  the  function  re‐
              served  word  is used,
              but  the   parentheses
              are  not supplied, the
              braces   are    recom‐
              mended.  compound-com‐
              mand is executed when‐
              ever  fname  is speci‐
              fied as the name of  a
              simple  command.  When
              in posix  mode,  fname
              must  be a valid shell
              name and  may  not  be
              the name of one of the
              POSIX          special
              builtins.  In  default
              mode,  a function name
              can  be  any  unquoted
              shell  word  that does
              not  contain  $.   Any
              redirections      (see
              REDIRECTION     below)
              specified when a func‐
              tion  is  defined  are
              performed   when   the
              function  is executed.
              The exit status  of  a
              function definition is
              zero  unless  a syntax
              error  occurs   or   a
              readonly function with
              the  same name already
              exists.    When   exe‐
              cuted, the exit status
              of  a  function is the
              exit  status  of   the
              last  command executed
              in  the  body.    (See
              FUNCTIONS below.)

COMMENTS
       In  a  non-interactive shell,
       or an  interactive  shell  in
       which   the  interactive_com‐
       ments  option  to  the  shopt
       builtin is enabled (see SHELL
       BUILTIN  COMMANDS  below),  a
       word beginning with #  causes
       that  word  and all remaining
       characters on that line to be
       ignored.    An    interactive
       shell  without  the  interac‐
       tive_comments option  enabled
       does not allow comments.  The
       interactive_comments   option
       is on by default in  interac‐
       tive shells.

QUOTING
       Quoting is used to remove the
       special  meaning  of  certain
       characters or  words  to  the
       shell.   Quoting  can be used
       to disable special  treatment
       for  special  characters,  to
       prevent reserved  words  from
       being recognized as such, and
       to  prevent  parameter expan‐
       sion.

       Each  of  the  metacharacters
       listed  above  under  DEFINI‐
       TIONS has special meaning  to
       the  shell and must be quoted
       if it is to represent itself.

       When the command history  ex‐
       pansion  facilities are being
       used (see  HISTORY  EXPANSION
       below), the history expansion
       character, usually !, must be
       quoted to prevent history ex‐
       pansion.

       There are three quoting mech‐
       anisms: the escape character,
       single   quotes,  and  double
       quotes.

       A non-quoted backslash (\) is
       the  escape  character.    It
       preserves  the  literal value
       of the  next  character  that
       follows,  with  the exception
       of <newline>.   If  a  \<new‐
       line>  pair  appears, and the
       backslash   is   not   itself
       quoted,   the  \<newline>  is
       treated as a  line  continua‐
       tion  (that is, it is removed
       from the input stream and ef‐
       fectively ignored).

       Enclosing characters in  sin‐
       gle quotes preserves the lit‐
       eral  value of each character
       within the quotes.  A  single
       quote  may  not occur between
       single quotes, even when pre‐
       ceded by a backslash.

       Enclosing characters in  dou‐
       ble quotes preserves the lit‐
       eral  value of all characters
       within the quotes,  with  the
       exception  of  $,  `, \, and,
       when history expansion is en‐
       abled, !.  When the shell  is
       in  posix  mode, the ! has no
       special meaning within double
       quotes, even when history ex‐
       pansion  is   enabled.    The
       characters  $  and  `  retain
       their special meaning  within
       double quotes.  The backslash
       retains  its  special meaning
       only when followed by one  of
       the  following characters: $,
       `, ",  \,  or  <newline>.   A
       double  quote  may  be quoted
       within double quotes by  pre‐
       ceding  it  with a backslash.
       If enabled, history expansion
       will be performed unless an !
       appearing in double quotes is
       escaped  using  a  backslash.
       The backslash preceding the !
       is not removed.

       The  special parameters * and
       @ have special  meaning  when
       in double quotes (see PARAME‐
       TERS below).

       Character  sequences  of  the
       form $'string' are treated as
       a special variant  of  single
       quotes.  The sequence expands
       to string, with backslash-es‐
       caped  characters  in  string
       replaced as specified by  the
       ANSI  C  standard.  Backslash
       escape sequences, if present,
       are decoded as follows:
              \a     alert (bell)
              \b     backspace
              \e
              \E     an escape char‐
                     acter
              \f     form feed
              \n     new line
              \r     carriage return
              \t     horizontal tab
              \v     vertical tab
              \\     backslash
              \'     single quote
              \"     double quote
              \?     question mark
              \nnn   the   eight-bit
                     character whose
                     value   is  the
                     octal value nnn
                     (one  to  three
                     octal digits)
              \xHH   the   eight-bit
                     character whose
                     value  is   the
                     hexadecimal
                     value  HH  (one
                     or two hex dig‐
                     its)
              \uHHHH the     Unicode
                     (ISO/IEC 10646)
                     character whose
                     value   is  the
                     hexadecimal
                     value HHHH (one
                     to   four   hex
                     digits)
              \UHHHHHHHH
                     the     Unicode
                     (ISO/IEC 10646)
                     character whose
                     value  is   the
                     hexadecimal
                     value  HHHHHHHH
                     (one  to  eight
                     hex digits)
              \cx    a     control-x
                     character

       The expanded result  is  sin‐
       gle-quoted,  as if the dollar
       sign had not been present.

       A double-quoted  string  pre‐
       ceded   by   a   dollar  sign
       ($"string")  will  cause  the
       string  to  be translated ac‐
       cording to  the  current  lo‐
       cale.    The  gettext  infra‐
       structure performs the lookup
       and  translation,  using  the
       LC_MESSAGES,   TEXTDOMAINDIR,
       and  TEXTDOMAIN  shell  vari‐
       ables.  If the current locale
       is  C  or POSIX, if there are
       no translations available, or
       if the string is  not  trans‐
       lated, the dollar sign is ig‐
       nored.   This  is  a  form of
       double quoting, so the string
       remains double-quoted by  de‐
       fault,  whether  or not it is
       translated and replaced.   If
       the  noexpand_translation op‐
       tion  is  enabled  using  the
       shopt   builtin,   translated
       strings are single-quoted in‐
       stead of double-quoted.   See
       the  description of shopt be‐
       low  under   SHELLBUILTINCOM‐
       MANDS.

PARAMETERS
       A parameter is an entity that
       stores  values.   It can be a
       name, a number, or one of the
       special characters listed be‐
       low under Special Parameters.
       A variable is a parameter de‐
       noted by a name.  A  variable
       has  a value and zero or more
       attributes.   Attributes  are
       assigned  using  the  declare
       builtin command (see  declare
       below  in  SHELL BUILTIN COM‐
       MANDS).

       A parameter is set if it  has
       been  assigned  a value.  The
       null string is a valid value.
       Once a variable  is  set,  it
       may  be  unset  only by using
       the  unset  builtin   command
       (see  SHELL  BUILTIN COMMANDS
       below).

       A variable may be assigned to
       by a statement of the form

              name=[value]

       If value is  not  given,  the
       variable is assigned the null
       string.   All  values undergo
       tilde  expansion,   parameter
       and  variable expansion, com‐
       mand substitution, arithmetic
       expansion, and quote  removal
       (see  EXPANSION  below).   If
       the variable has its  integer
       attribute  set, then value is
       evaluated  as  an  arithmetic
       expression    even   if   the
       $((...))  expansion  is   not
       used  (see  Arithmetic Expan‐
       sion below).  Word  splitting
       and  pathname  expansion  are
       not  performed.    Assignment
       statements may also appear as
       arguments  to  the alias, de‐
       clare, typeset, export, read‐
       only, and local builtin  com‐
       mands (declaration commands).
       When  in  posix  mode,  these
       builtins may appear in a com‐
       mand after one  or  more  in‐
       stances    of   the   command
       builtin and retain these  as‐
       signment   statement  proper‐
       ties.

       In the context where  an  as‐
       signment statement is assign‐
       ing  a value to a shell vari‐
       able or array index,  the  +=
       operator  can  be used to ap‐
       pend to or add to  the  vari‐
       able's  previous value.  This
       includes arguments to builtin
       commands such as declare that
       accept assignment  statements
       (declaration commands).  When
       +=  is  applied to a variable
       for  which  the  integer  at‐
       tribute  has  been set, value
       is evaluated as an arithmetic
       expression and added  to  the
       variable's   current   value,
       which  is   also   evaluated.
       When  += is applied to an ar‐
       ray variable  using  compound
       assignment  (see  Arrays  be‐
       low), the variable's value is
       not unset (as it is when  us‐
       ing  =),  and  new values are
       appended to the array  begin‐
       ning  at one greater than the
       array's  maximum  index  (for
       indexed  arrays)  or added as
       additional key-value pairs in
       an associative  array.   When
       applied  to  a  string-valued
       variable, value  is  expanded
       and  appended  to  the  vari‐
       able's value.

       A variable  can  be  assigned
       the  nameref  attribute using
       the -n option to the  declare
       or   local  builtin  commands
       (see the descriptions of  de‐
       clare  and  local  below)  to
       create a nameref, or a refer‐
       ence  to  another   variable.
       This  allows  variables to be
       manipulated       indirectly.
       Whenever the nameref variable
       is  referenced,  assigned to,
       unset, or has its  attributes
       modified (other than using or
       changing   the   nameref  at‐
       tribute itself),  the  opera‐
       tion is actually performed on
       the variable specified by the
       nameref  variable's value.  A
       nameref  is   commonly   used
       within shell functions to re‐
       fer  to a variable whose name
       is passed as an  argument  to
       the  function.  For instance,
       if a variable name is  passed
       to  a  shell  function as its
       first argument, running
              declare -n ref=$1
       inside the function creates a
       nameref  variable  ref  whose
       value  is  the  variable name
       passed as the first argument.
       References and assignments to
       ref, and changes to  its  at‐
       tributes, are treated as ref‐
       erences, assignments, and at‐
       tribute  modifications to the
       variable   whose   name   was
       passed as $1.  If the control
       variable  in  a  for loop has
       the  nameref  attribute,  the
       list  of  words can be a list
       of  shell  variables,  and  a
       name reference will be estab‐
       lished  for  each word in the
       list, in turn, when the  loop
       is executed.  Array variables
       cannot  be  given the nameref
       attribute.  However,  nameref
       variables can reference array
       variables and subscripted ar‐
       ray  variables.  Namerefs can
       be unset using the -n  option
       to the unset builtin.  Other‐
       wise,  if  unset  is executed
       with the name  of  a  nameref
       variable  as an argument, the
       variable  referenced  by  the
       nameref  variable will be un‐
       set.

   Positional Parameters
       A positional parameter  is  a
       parameter  denoted  by one or
       more digits, other  than  the
       single  digit  0.  Positional
       parameters are assigned  from
       the shell's arguments when it
       is  invoked, and may be reas‐
       signed using the set  builtin
       command.   Positional parame‐
       ters may not be  assigned  to
       with  assignment  statements.
       The positional parameters are
       temporarily replaced  when  a
       shell  function  is  executed
       (see FUNCTIONS below).

       When a  positional  parameter
       consisting  of  more  than  a
       single digit is expanded,  it
       must  be  enclosed  in braces
       (see EXPANSION below).

   Special Parameters
       The shell treats several  pa‐
       rameters   specially.   These
       parameters may only be refer‐
       enced; assignment to them  is
       not allowed.
       *      Expands  to  the posi‐
              tional     parameters,
              starting   from   one.
              When the expansion  is
              not    within   double
              quotes,   each   posi‐
              tional  parameter  ex‐
              pands  to  a  separate
              word.    In   contexts
              where it is performed,
              those words  are  sub‐
              ject  to  further word
              splitting and pathname
              expansion.   When  the
              expansion       occurs
              within double  quotes,
              it expands to a single
              word with the value of
              each  parameter  sepa‐
              rated  by  the   first
              character  of  the IFS
              special      variable.
              That   is,   "$*"   is
              equivalent          to
              "$1c$2c...",  where  c
              is the first character
              of the  value  of  the
              IFS  variable.  If IFS
              is unset, the  parame‐
              ters  are separated by
              spaces.   If  IFS   is
              null,  the  parameters
              are joined without in‐
              tervening separators.
       @      Expands to  the  posi‐
              tional     parameters,
              starting from one.  In
              contexts  where   word
              splitting    is   per‐
              formed,  this  expands
              each  positional para‐
              meter  to  a  separate
              word;  if  not  within
              double  quotes,  these
              words  are  subject to
              word  splitting.    In
              contexts   where  word
              splitting is not  per‐
              formed,  this  expands
              to a single word  with
              each  positional para‐
              meter separated  by  a
              space.   When  the ex‐
              pansion occurs  within
              double   quotes,  each
              parameter expands to a
              separate  word.   That
              is, "$@" is equivalent
              to  "$1"  "$2" ...  If
              the double-quoted  ex‐
              pansion  occurs within
              a word, the  expansion
              of the first parameter
              is joined with the be‐
              ginning  part  of  the
              original word, and the
              expansion of the  last
              parameter   is  joined
              with the last part  of
              the   original   word.
              When there are no  po‐
              sitional   parameters,
              "$@" and $@ expand  to
              nothing   (i.e.,  they
              are removed).
       #      Expands to the  number
              of  positional parame‐
              ters in decimal.
       ?      Expands  to  the  exit
              status of the most re‐
              cently  executed fore‐
              ground pipeline.
       -      Expands to the current
              option flags as speci‐
              fied upon  invocation,
              by   the  set  builtin
              command, or those  set
              by  the  shell  itself
              (such as  the  -i  op‐
              tion).
       $      Expands to the process
              ID  of the shell. In a
              subshell,  it  expands
              to  the  process ID of
              the current shell, not
              the subshell.
       !      Expands to the process
              ID of the job most re‐
              cently placed into the
              background,    whether
              executed  as  an asyn‐
              chronous  command   or
              using  the  bg builtin
              (see JOB  CONTROL  be‐
              low).
       0      Expands to the name of
              the   shell  or  shell
              script.  This  is  set
              at  shell  initializa‐
              tion.  If bash is  in‐
              voked  with  a file of
              commands, $0 is set to
              the name of that file.
              If  bash  is   started
              with  the  -c  option,
              then $0 is set to  the
              first  argument  after
              the string to be  exe‐
              cuted,   if   one   is
              present.    Otherwise,
              it is set to the file‐
              name  used  to  invoke
              bash, as given by  ar‐
              gument zero.

   Shell Variables
       The  following  variables are
       set by the shell:

       _      At shell startup,  set
              to  the  pathname used
              to invoke the shell or
              shell script being ex‐
              ecuted  as  passed  in
              the environment or ar‐
              gument  list.   Subse‐
              quently,  expands   to
              the  last  argument to
              the  previous   simple
              command   executed  in
              the foreground,  after
              expansion.   Also  set
              to the  full  pathname
              used  to  invoke  each
              command  executed  and
              placed in the environ‐
              ment  exported to that
              command.  When  check‐
              ing mail, this parame‐
              ter  holds the name of
              the  mail  file   cur‐
              rently being checked.
       BASH   Expands  to  the  full
              filename used  to  in‐
              voke  this instance of
              bash.
       BASHOPTS
              A colon-separated list
              of enabled  shell  op‐
              tions.   Each  word in
              the list  is  a  valid
              argument  for  the  -s
              option  to  the  shopt
              builtin  command  (see
              SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
              below).   The  options
              appearing  in BASHOPTS
              are those reported  as
              on  by shopt.  If this
              variable is in the en‐
              vironment  when   bash
              starts  up, each shell
              option  in  the   list
              will be enabled before
              reading   any  startup
              files.  This  variable
              is read-only.
       BASHPID
              Expands to the process
              ID of the current bash
              process.  This differs
              from  $$ under certain
              circumstances, such as
              subshells that do  not
              require bash to be re-
              initialized.   Assign‐
              ments to BASHPID  have
              no effect.  If BASHPID
              is unset, it loses its
              special    properties,
              even if it  is  subse‐
              quently reset.
       BASH_ALIASES
              An  associative  array
              variable whose members
              correspond to the  in‐
              ternal list of aliases
              as  maintained  by the
              alias  builtin.   Ele‐
              ments  added  to  this
              array  appear  in  the
              alias  list;  however,
              unsetting  array  ele‐
              ments  currently  does
              not cause  aliases  to
              be  removed  from  the
              alias    list.      If
              BASH_ALIASES is unset,
              it  loses  its special
              properties, even if it
              is subsequently reset.
       BASH_ARGC
              An   array    variable
              whose  values  are the
              number  of  parameters
              in  each  frame of the
              current bash execution
              call stack.  The  num‐
              ber  of  parameters to
              the current subroutine
              (shell   function   or
              script executed with .
              or  source)  is at the
              top  of   the   stack.
              When  a  subroutine is
              executed,  the  number
              of  parameters  passed
              is     pushed     onto
              BASH_ARGC.   The shell
              sets  BASH_ARGC   only
              when  in  extended de‐
              bugging mode (see  the
              description   of   the
              extdebug option to the
              shopt builtin  below).
              Setting extdebug after
              the  shell has started
              to execute  a  script,
              or   referencing  this
              variable when extdebug
              is not set, may result
              in  inconsistent  val‐
              ues.
       BASH_ARGV
              An array variable con‐
              taining all of the pa‐
              rameters  in  the cur‐
              rent  bash   execution
              call stack.  The final
              parameter  of the last
              subroutine call is  at
              the  top of the stack;
              the first parameter of
              the initial call is at
              the  bottom.   When  a
              subroutine   is   exe‐
              cuted, the  parameters
              supplied   are  pushed
              onto  BASH_ARGV.   The
              shell  sets  BASH_ARGV
              only when in  extended
              debugging   mode  (see
              the description of the
              extdebug option to the
              shopt builtin  below).
              Setting extdebug after
              the  shell has started
              to execute  a  script,
              or   referencing  this
              variable when extdebug
              is not set, may result
              in  inconsistent  val‐
              ues.
       BASH_ARGV0
              When  referenced, this
              variable  expands   to
              the  name of the shell
              or shell script (iden‐
              tical to $0;  see  the
              description of special
              parameter   0  above).
              Assignment          to
              BASH_ARGV0  causes the
              value assigned to also
              be assigned to $0.  If
              BASH_ARGV0  is  unset,
              it  loses  its special
              properties, even if it
              is subsequently reset.
       BASH_CMDS
              An  associative  array
              variable whose members
              correspond  to the in‐
              ternal hash  table  of
              commands as maintained
              by  the  hash builtin.
              Elements added to this
              array  appear  in  the
              hash  table;  however,
              unsetting  array  ele‐
              ments  currently  does
              not   cause    command
              names  to  be  removed
              from the  hash  table.
              If BASH_CMDS is unset,
              it  loses  its special
              properties, even if it
              is subsequently reset.
       BASH_COMMAND
              The command  currently
              being    executed   or
              about to be  executed,
              unless  the  shell  is
              executing a command as
              the result of a  trap,
              in  which  case  it is
              the command  executing
              at  the  time  of  the
              trap.  If BASH_COMMAND
              is unset, it loses its
              special    properties,
              even  if  it is subse‐
              quently reset.
       BASH_EXECUTION_STRING
              The  command  argument
              to  the  -c invocation
              option.
       BASH_LINENO
              An   array    variable
              whose  members are the
              line numbers in source
              files where each  cor‐
              responding  member  of
              FUNCNAME was  invoked.
              ${BASH_LINENO[$i]}  is
              the line number in the
              source            file
              (${BASH_SOURCE[$i+1]})
              where  ${FUNCNAME[$i]}
              was     called     (or
              ${BASH_LINENO[$i-1]}
              if  referenced  within
              another  shell   func‐
              tion).   Use LINENO to
              obtain   the   current
              line number.
       BASH_LOADABLES_PATH
              A colon-separated list
              of    directories   in
              which the shell  looks
              for  dynamically load‐
              able  builtins  speci‐
              fied   by  the  enable
              command.
       BASH_REMATCH
              An   array    variable
              whose  members are as‐
              signed by the  =~  bi‐
              nary  operator  to the
              [[  conditional   com‐
              mand.    The   element
              with index  0  is  the
              portion  of the string
              matching  the   entire
              regular    expression.
              The element with index
              n is  the  portion  of
              the   string  matching
              the nth  parenthesized
              subexpression.
       BASH_SOURCE
              An    array   variable
              whose members are  the
              source filenames where
              the      corresponding
              shell  function  names
              in  the FUNCNAME array
              variable are  defined.
              The   shell   function
              ${FUNCNAME[$i]} is de‐
              fined  in   the   file
              ${BASH_SOURCE[$i]} and
              called            from
              ${BASH_SOURCE[$i+1]}.
       BASH_SUBSHELL
              Incremented   by   one
              within  each  subshell
              or  subshell  environ‐
              ment  when  the  shell
              begins  executing   in
              that environment.  The
              initial  value  is  0.
              If  BASH_SUBSHELL   is
              unset,  it  loses  its
              special    properties,
              even  if  it is subse‐
              quently reset.
       BASH_VERSINFO
              A readonly array vari‐
              able   whose   members
              hold  version informa‐
              tion for this instance
              of bash.   The  values
              assigned  to the array
              members  are  as  fol‐
              lows:

                                      (e.g.,
                                      beta1).
              BASH_VERSINFO[5]        The
                                      value
                                      of

       BASH_VERSION
              Expands  to  a  string
              describing the version
              of  this  instance  of
              bash.
       COMP_CWORD
              An      index     into
              ${COMP_WORDS}  of  the
              word   containing  the
              current  cursor  posi‐
              tion.   This  variable
              is available  only  in
              shell   functions  in‐
              voked by the  program‐
              mable  completion  fa‐
              cilities (see Program‐

              low).
       COMP_KEY
              The  key (or final key
              of  a  key   sequence)
              used   to  invoke  the
              current     completion
              function.
       COMP_LINE
              The   current  command
              line.   This  variable
              is  available  only in
              shell  functions   and
              external  commands in‐
              voked by the  program‐

              The  index of the cur‐
              rent  cursor  position
              relative to the begin‐
              ning  of  the  current
              command.  If the  cur‐
              rent  cursor  position
              is at the end  of  the
              current  command,  the
              value of this variable
              is      equal       to
              ${#COMP_LINE}.    This
              variable is  available
              only  in  shell  func‐
              tions   and   external
              commands   invoked  by
              the programmable  com‐
              pletion     facilities
              (see Programmable Com‐
              pletion below).
       COMP_TYPE
              Set  to   an   integer
              value corresponding to
              the type of completion
              attempted  that caused
              a completion  function
              to be called: TAB, for
              normal  completion, ?,

              tions after successive
              tabs,  !,  for listing
              alternatives  on  par‐
              tial  word completion,
              @, to list completions
              if the word is not un‐
              modified,  or  %,  for
              menu completion.  This
              variable  is available
              only  in  shell  func‐
              tions   and   external
              commands  invoked   by
              the  programmable com‐
              pletion     facilities

              that the readline  li‐
              brary  treats  as word
              separators  when  per‐

              tion.   If  COMP_WORD‐
              BREAKS  is  unset,  it
              loses   its    special
              properties, even if it
              is subsequently reset.
       COMP_WORDS
              An array variable (see
              Arrays below) consist‐
              ing  of the individual
              words in  the  current
              command   line.    The
              line  is  split   into
              words    as   readline
              would split it,  using
              COMP_WORDBREAKS as de‐
              scribed  above.   This
              variable is  available
              only  in  shell  func‐
              tions invoked  by  the
              programmable   comple‐
              tion  facilities  (see
              Programmable   Comple‐
              tion below).
       COPROC An array variable (see
              Arrays below)  created
              to  hold  the file de‐
              scriptors  for  output
              from  and  input to an
              unnamed coprocess (see
              Coprocesses above).
       DIRSTACK
              An array variable (see
              Arrays below) contain‐
              ing the  current  con‐
              tents of the directory
              stack.     Directories
              appear in the stack in
              the  order  they   are
              displayed  by the dirs
              builtin.  Assigning to
              members of this  array
              variable  may  be used
              to modify  directories
              already  in the stack,
              but the pushd and popd
              builtins must be  used
              to  add and remove di‐
              rectories.  Assignment
              to this variable  will
              not change the current
              directory.          If
              DIRSTACK is unset,  it
              loses    its   special
              properties, even if it
              is subsequently reset.
       EPOCHREALTIME
              Each time this parame‐
              ter is referenced,  it
              expands  to the number
              of seconds  since  the
              Unix     Epoch    (see
              time(3)) as a floating
              point value  with  mi‐
              cro-second   granular‐
              ity.   Assignments  to
              EPOCHREALTIME  are ig‐
              nored.  If  EPOCHREAL‐
              TIME   is   unset,  it
              loses   its    special
              properties, even if it
              is subsequently reset.
       EPOCHSECONDS
              Each time this parame‐
              ter  is referenced, it
              expands to the  number
              of  seconds  since the
              Unix    Epoch     (see
              time(3)).  Assignments
              to   EPOCHSECONDS  are
              ignored.  If EPOCHSEC‐
              ONDS  is   unset,   it
              loses    its   special
              properties, even if it
              is subsequently reset.
       EUID   Expands to the  effec‐
              tive  user  ID  of the
              current user, initial‐
              ized at shell startup.
              This variable is read‐
              only.
       FUNCNAME
              An array variable con‐
              taining the  names  of
              all   shell  functions
              currently in the  exe‐
              cution   call   stack.
              The element with index
              0 is the name  of  any
              currently-executing
              shell  function.   The
              bottom-most    element
              (the   one   with  the
              highest   index)    is
              "main".  This variable
              exists   only  when  a
              shell function is exe‐
              cuting.    Assignments
              to  FUNCNAME  have  no
              effect.   If  FUNCNAME
              is unset, it loses its
              special    properties,
              even if it  is  subse‐
              quently reset.

              This  variable  can be
              used with  BASH_LINENO
              and BASH_SOURCE.  Each
              element   of  FUNCNAME
              has corresponding ele‐
              ments  in  BASH_LINENO
              and BASH_SOURCE to de‐
              scribe the call stack.
              For  instance, ${FUNC‐
              NAME[$i]}  was  called
              from      the     file
              ${BASH_SOURCE[$i+1]}
              at     line     number
              ${BASH_LINENO[$i]}.
              The   caller   builtin
              displays  the  current
              call  stack using this
              information.
       GROUPS An array variable con‐
              taining  the  list  of
              groups  of  which  the
              current user is a mem‐
              ber.   Assignments  to
              GROUPS have no effect.
              If GROUPS is unset, it
              loses    its   special
              properties, even if it
              is subsequently reset.
       HISTCMD
              The history number, or
              index in  the  history
              list,  of  the current
              command.   Assignments
              to   HISTCMD  are  ig‐
              nored.  If HISTCMD  is
              unset,  it  loses  its
              special    properties,
              even  if  it is subse‐
              quently reset.
       HOSTNAME
              Automatically  set  to
              the  name  of the cur‐
              rent host.
       HOSTTYPE
              Automatically set to a
              string  that  uniquely
              describes  the type of
              machine on which  bash
              is executing.  The de‐
              fault is system-depen‐
              dent.
       LINENO Each time this parame‐
              ter is referenced, the
              shell   substitutes  a
              decimal number  repre‐
              senting   the  current
              sequential line number
              (starting   with    1)
              within   a  script  or
              function.  When not in
              a script or  function,
              the  value substituted
              is not  guaranteed  to
              be   meaningful.    If
              LINENO  is  unset,  it
              loses    its   special
              properties, even if it
              is subsequently reset.
       MACHTYPE
              Automatically set to a
              string that fully  de‐
              scribes   the   system
              type on which bash  is
              executing,    in   the
              standard GNU  cpu-com‐
              pany-system    format.
              The default is system-
              dependent.
       MAPFILE
              An array variable (see
              Arrays below)  created
              to  hold the text read
              by the mapfile builtin
              when no variable  name
              is supplied.
       OLDPWD The  previous  working
              directory  as  set  by
              the cd command.
       OPTARG The  value of the last
              option        argument
              processed    by    the
              getopts  builtin  com‐
              mand     (see    SHELL
              BUILTIN  COMMANDS  be‐
              low).
       OPTIND The  index of the next
              argument     to     be
              processed    by    the
              getopts  builtin  com‐
              mand     (see    SHELL
              BUILTIN  COMMANDS  be‐
              low).
       OSTYPE Automatically set to a
              string  that describes
              the  operating  system
              on  which bash is exe‐
              cuting.   The  default
              is system-dependent.
       PIPESTATUS
              An array variable (see
              Arrays below) contain‐
              ing  a  list  of  exit
              status values from the
              processes in the most-
              recently-executed
              foreground    pipeline
              (which   may   contain
              only  a  single   com‐
              mand).
       PPID   The  process ID of the
              shell's parent.   This
              variable is readonly.
       PWD    The   current  working
              directory  as  set  by
              the cd command.
       RANDOM Each time this parame‐
              ter  is referenced, it
              expands  to  a  random
              integer  between 0 and
              32767.   Assigning   a
              value  to  RANDOM ini‐
              tializes  (seeds)  the
              sequence   of   random
              numbers.  If RANDOM is
              unset,  it  loses  its
              special    properties,
              even if it  is  subse‐
              quently reset.
       READLINE_ARGUMENT
              Any  numeric  argument
              given  to  a  readline
              command  that  was de‐
              fined using "bind  -x"
              (see   SHELL   BUILTIN
              COMMANDS  below)  when
              it was invoked.
       READLINE_LINE
              The  contents  of  the
              readline line  buffer,
              for use with "bind -x"
              (see   SHELL   BUILTIN
              COMMANDS below).
       READLINE_MARK
              The  position  of  the
              mark  (saved insertion
              point) in the readline
              line buffer,  for  use
              with  "bind  -x"  (see
              SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
              below).   The  charac‐
              ters  between  the in‐
              sertion point and  the
              mark  are often called
              the region.
       READLINE_POINT
              The  position  of  the
              insertion point in the
              readline  line buffer,
              for use with "bind -x"
              (see   SHELL   BUILTIN
              COMMANDS below).
       REPLY  Set to the line of in‐
              put  read  by the read
              builtin  command  when
              no  arguments are sup‐
              plied.
       SECONDS
              Each time this parame‐
              ter is referenced,  it
              expands  to the number
              of seconds since shell
              invocation.    If    a
              value  is  assigned to
              SECONDS, the value re‐
              turned upon subsequent
              references is the num‐
              ber of  seconds  since
              the   assignment  plus
              the  value   assigned.
              The  number of seconds
              at  shell   invocation
              and  the  current time
              are always  determined
              by querying the system
              clock.   If SECONDS is
              unset,  it  loses  its
              special    properties,
              even if it  is  subse‐
              quently reset.
       SHELLOPTS
              A colon-separated list
              of  enabled  shell op‐
              tions.  Each  word  in
              the  list  is  a valid
              argument  for  the  -o
              option   to   the  set
              builtin  command  (see
              SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
              below).   The  options
              appearing in SHELLOPTS
              are those reported  as
              on by set -o.  If this
              variable is in the en‐
              vironment   when  bash
              starts up, each  shell
              option   in  the  list
              will be enabled before
              reading  any   startup
              files.   This variable
              is read-only.
       SHLVL  Incremented   by   one
              each  time an instance
              of bash is started.
       SRANDOM
              This variable  expands
              to  a  32-bit  pseudo-
              random   number   each
              time it is referenced.
              The random number gen‐
              erator  is  not linear
              on systems  that  sup‐
              port  /dev/urandom  or
              arc4random,  so   each
              returned number has no
              relationship   to  the
              numbers preceding  it.
              The random number gen‐
              erator    cannot    be
              seeded, so assignments
              to this variable  have
              no effect.  If SRANDOM
              is unset, it loses its
              special    properties,
              even if it  is  subse‐
              quently reset.
       UID    Expands to the user ID
              of  the  current user,
              initialized  at  shell
              startup.   This  vari‐
              able is readonly.

       The following  variables  are
       used  by  the shell.  In some
       cases, bash assigns a default
       value to  a  variable;  these
       cases are noted below.

       BASH_COMPAT
              The  value  is used to
              set the  shell's  com‐
              patibility level.  See
              SHELL    COMPATIBILITY
              MODE below for  a  de‐
              scription of the vari‐
              ous compatibility lev‐
              els and their effects.
              The  value  may  be  a
              decimal number  (e.g.,
              4.2)   or  an  integer
              (e.g., 42) correspond‐
              ing  to  the   desired
              compatibility   level.
              If BASH_COMPAT is  un‐
              set   or  set  to  the
              empty string, the com‐
              patibility  level   is
              set to the default for
              the  current  version.
              If BASH_COMPAT is  set
              to a value that is not
              one  of the valid com‐
              patibility levels, the
              shell prints an  error
              message  and  sets the
              compatibility level to
              the  default  for  the
              current  version.  The
              valid  values   corre‐
              spond  to the compati‐
              bility   levels    de‐
              scribed   below  under
              SHELL    COMPATIBILITY
              MODE.    For  example,
              4.2 and 42  are  valid
              values that correspond
              to  the compat42 shopt
              option  and  set   the
              compatibility level to
              42.   The current ver‐
              sion is also  a  valid
              value.
       BASH_ENV
              If  this  parameter is
              set when bash is  exe‐
              cuting a shell script,
              its  value  is  inter‐
              preted as  a  filename
              containing commands to
              initialize  the shell,
              as in ~/.bashrc.   The
              value  of  BASH_ENV is
              subjected to parameter
              expansion,     command
              substitution,      and
              arithmetic   expansion
              before   being  inter‐
              preted as a  filename.
              PATH  is  not  used to
              search for the  resul‐
              tant filename.
       BASH_XTRACEFD
              If  set  to an integer
              corresponding   to   a
              valid file descriptor,
              bash  will  write  the
              trace output generated
              when set -x is enabled
              to that file  descrip‐
              tor.    The  file  de‐
              scriptor   is   closed
              when  BASH_XTRACEFD is
              unset  or  assigned  a
              new  value.  Unsetting
              BASH_XTRACEFD  or  as‐
              signing  it  the empty
              string   causes    the
              trace   output  to  be
              sent to  the  standard
              error.  Note that set‐
              ting  BASH_XTRACEFD to
              2 (the standard  error
              file  descriptor)  and
              then unsetting it will
              result in the standard
              error being closed.
       CDPATH The  search  path  for
              the  cd command.  This
              is  a  colon-separated
              list of directories in
              which  the shell looks
              for destination direc‐
              tories  specified   by
              the   cd  command.   A
              sample    value     is
              ".:~:/usr".
       CHILD_MAX
              Set  the number of ex‐
              ited child status val‐
              ues for the  shell  to
              remember.   Bash  will
              not allow  this  value
              to  be decreased below
              a POSIX-mandated mini‐
              mum, and  there  is  a
              maximum   value  (cur‐
              rently 8192) that this
              may not  exceed.   The
              minimum  value is sys‐
              tem-dependent.
       COLUMNS
              Used  by  the   select
              compound   command  to
              determine the terminal
              width  when   printing
              selection  lists.  Au‐
              tomatically set if the
              checkwinsize option is
              enabled or in  an  in‐
              teractive  shell  upon
              receipt of a SIGWINCH.
       COMPREPLY
              An array variable from
              which bash  reads  the
              possible   completions
              generated by  a  shell
              function   invoked  by
              the programmable  com‐
              pletion  facility (see
              Programmable   Comple‐
              tion below).  Each ar‐
              ray  element  contains
              one  possible  comple‐
              tion.
       EMACS  If   bash  finds  this
              variable in the  envi‐
              ronment when the shell
              starts with value "t",
              it  assumes  that  the
              shell is running in an
              Emacs shell buffer and
              disables line editing.
       ENV    Expanded and  executed
              similarly  to BASH_ENV
              (see INVOCATION above)
              when  an   interactive
              shell  is  invoked  in
              posix mode.
       EXECIGNORE
              A colon-separated list
              of shell patterns (see
              Pattern      Matching)
              defining  the  list of
              filenames  to  be  ig‐
              nored    by    command
              search   using   PATH.
              Files whose full path‐
              names   match  one  of
              these patterns are not
              considered  executable
              files for the purposes
              of completion and com‐
              mand   execution   via
              PATH   lookup.    This
              does  not  affect  the
              behavior  of  the   [,
              test, and [[ commands.
              Full  pathnames in the
              command hash table are
              not subject to EXECIG‐
              NORE.  Use this  vari‐
              able  to ignore shared
              library   files   that
              have   the  executable
              bit set, but  are  not
              executable files.  The
              pattern  matching hon‐
              ors the setting of the
              extglob shell option.
       FCEDIT The default editor for
              the  fc  builtin  com‐
              mand.
       FIGNORE
              A colon-separated list
              of  suffixes to ignore
              when performing  file‐
              name  completion  (see
              READLINE  below).    A
              filename  whose suffix
              matches one of the en‐
              tries  in  FIGNORE  is
              excluded from the list
              of  matched filenames.
              A  sample   value   is
              ".o:~"   (Quoting   is
              needed when  assigning
              a  value to this vari‐
              able,  which  contains
              tildes).
       FUNCNEST
              If  set  to  a numeric
              value greater than  0,
              defines    a   maximum
              function       nesting
              level.  Function invo‐
              cations   that  exceed
              this   nesting   level
              will cause the current
              command to abort.
       GLOBIGNORE
              A colon-separated list
              of  patterns  defining
              the set of file  names
              to be ignored by path‐
              name  expansion.  If a
              file name matched by a
              pathname     expansion
              pattern  also  matches
              one of the patterns in
              GLOBIGNORE, it is  re‐
              moved from the list of
              matches.
       HISTCONTROL
              A colon-separated list
              of  values controlling
              how commands are saved
              on the  history  list.
              If  the list of values
              includes  ignorespace,
              lines which begin with
              a  space character are
              not saved in the  his‐
              tory list.  A value of
              ignoredups      causes
              lines   matching   the
              previous history entry
              to  not  be  saved.  A
              value of ignoreboth is
              shorthand for  ignore‐
              space  and ignoredups.
              A value  of  erasedups
              causes   all  previous
              lines   matching   the
              current line to be re‐
              moved from the history
              list  before that line
              is saved.   Any  value
              not  in the above list
              is ignored.  If  HIST‐
              CONTROL  is  unset, or
              does  not  include   a
              valid value, all lines
              read   by   the  shell
              parser  are  saved  on
              the history list, sub‐
              ject  to  the value of
              HISTIGNORE.  The  sec‐
              ond   and   subsequent
              lines of a  multi-line
              compound  command  are
              not  tested,  and  are
              added  to  the history
              regardless   of    the
              value of HISTCONTROL.
       HISTFILE
              The  name  of the file
              in which command  his‐
              tory   is  saved  (see
              HISTORY  below).   The
              default    value    is
              ~/.bash_history.    If
              unset,   the   command
              history is  not  saved
              when a shell exits.
       HISTFILESIZE
              The  maximum number of
              lines contained in the
              history  file.    When
              this  variable  is as‐
              signed  a  value,  the
              history  file is trun‐
              cated,  if  necessary,
              to   contain  no  more
              than  that  number  of
              lines  by removing the
              oldest  entries.   The
              history  file  is also
              truncated to this size
              after writing it  when
              a shell exits.  If the
              value  is  0, the his‐
              tory file is truncated
              to zero size.  Non-nu‐
              meric values  and  nu‐
              meric values less than
              zero  inhibit  trunca‐
              tion.  The shell  sets
              the  default  value to
              the value of  HISTSIZE
              after    reading   any
              startup files.
       HISTIGNORE
              A colon-separated list
              of  patterns  used  to
              decide  which  command
              lines should be  saved
              on  the  history list.
              Each  pattern  is  an‐
              chored  at  the begin‐
              ning of the  line  and
              must  match  the  com‐
              plete  line  (no   im‐
              plicit   `*'   is  ap‐
              pended).  Each pattern
              is tested against  the
              line  after the checks
              specified by  HISTCON‐
              TROL  are applied.  In
              addition to the normal
              shell pattern matching
              characters,        `&'
              matches  the  previous
              history line.  `&' may
              be  escaped  using   a
              backslash;  the  back‐
              slash is  removed  be‐
              fore    attempting   a
              match.  The second and
              subsequent lines of  a
              multi-line    compound
              command    are     not
              tested,  and are added
              to the history regard‐
              less of the  value  of
              HISTIGNORE.   The pat‐
              tern  matching  honors
              the   setting  of  the
              extglob shell option.
       HISTSIZE
              The number of commands
              to  remember  in   the
              command  history  (see
              HISTORY  below).    If
              the  value  is 0, com‐
              mands are not saved in
              the history list.  Nu‐
              meric values less than
              zero result  in  every
              command being saved on
              the    history    list
              (there is  no  limit).
              The shell sets the de‐
              fault value to 500 af‐
              ter     reading    any
              startup files.
       HISTTIMEFORMAT
              If  this  variable  is
              set  and not null, its
              value  is  used  as  a
              format    string   for
              strftime(3)  to  print
              the time stamp associ‐
              ated with each history
              entry displayed by the
              history  builtin.   If
              this variable is  set,
              time  stamps are writ‐
              ten  to  the   history
              file  so  they  may be
              preserved across shell
              sessions.   This  uses
              the   history  comment
              character  to  distin‐
              guish  timestamps from
              other history lines.
       HOME   The home directory  of
              the  current user; the
              default  argument  for
              the  cd  builtin  com‐
              mand.   The  value  of
              this  variable is also
              used  when  performing
              tilde expansion.
       HOSTFILE
              Contains the name of a
              file  in the same for‐
              mat as /etc/hosts that
              should  be  read  when
              the   shell  needs  to
              complete  a  hostname.
              The  list  of possible
              hostname   completions
              may  be  changed while
              the shell is  running;
              the next time hostname
              completion    is   at‐
              tempted   after    the
              value is changed, bash
              adds  the  contents of
              the new  file  to  the
              existing   list.    If
              HOSTFILE is  set,  but
              has  no value, or does
              not  name  a  readable
              file, bash attempts to
              read /etc/hosts to ob‐
              tain  the list of pos‐
              sible hostname comple‐
              tions.  When  HOSTFILE
              is unset, the hostname
              list is cleared.
       IFS    The   Internal   Field
              Separator that is used
              for word splitting af‐
              ter expansion  and  to
              split lines into words
              with  the read builtin
              command.  The  default
              value               is
              ``<space><tab><new‐
              line>''.
       IGNOREEOF
              Controls the action of
              an  interactive  shell
              on  receipt  of an EOF
              character as the  sole
              input.   If  set,  the
              value is the number of
              consecutive EOF  char‐
              acters  which  must be
              typed  as  the   first
              characters on an input
              line  before  bash ex‐
              its.  If the  variable
              exists  but  does  not
              have a numeric  value,
              or  has  no value, the
              default value  is  10.
              If  it does not exist,
              EOF signifies the  end
              of input to the shell.
       INPUTRC
              The  filename  for the
              readline startup file,
              overriding the default
              of   ~/.inputrc   (see
              READLINE below).
       INSIDE_EMACS
              If  this  variable ap‐
              pears in the  environ‐
              ment  when  the  shell
              starts,  bash  assumes
              that it is running in‐
              side  an  Emacs  shell
              buffer and may disable
              line editing,  depend‐
              ing  on  the  value of
              TERM.
       LANG   Used to determine  the
              locale   category  for
              any    category    not
              specifically  selected
              with a variable start‐
              ing with LC_.
       LC_ALL This  variable   over‐
              rides   the  value  of
              LANG and any other LC_
              variable specifying  a
              locale category.
       LC_COLLATE
              This  variable  deter‐
              mines  the   collation
              order  used when sort‐
              ing  the  results   of
              pathname    expansion,
              and determines the be‐
              havior  of  range  ex‐
              pressions, equivalence
              classes, and collating
              sequences within path‐
              name   expansion   and
              pattern matching.
       LC_CTYPE
              This  variable  deter‐
              mines  the interpreta‐
              tion of characters and
              the behavior of  char‐
              acter  classes  within
              pathname expansion and
              pattern matching.
       LC_MESSAGES
              This  variable  deter‐
              mines  the locale used
              to  translate  double-
              quoted   strings  pre‐
              ceded by a $.
       LC_NUMERIC
              This  variable  deter‐
              mines the locale cate‐
              gory  used  for number
              formatting.
       LC_TIME
              This  variable  deter‐
              mines the locale cate‐
              gory used for data and
              time formatting.
       LINES  Used   by  the  select
              compound  command   to
              determine  the  column
              length  for   printing
              selection  lists.  Au‐
              tomatically set if the
              checkwinsize option is
              enabled or in  an  in‐
              teractive  shell  upon
              receipt of a SIGWINCH.
       MAIL   If this  parameter  is
              set  to  a file or di‐
              rectory name  and  the
              MAILPATH  variable  is
              not set, bash  informs
              the  user  of  the ar‐
              rival of mail  in  the
              specified    file   or
              Maildir-format  direc‐
              tory.
       MAILCHECK
              Specifies   how  often
              (in   seconds)    bash
              checks  for mail.  The
              default is 60 seconds.
              When  it  is  time  to
              check  for  mail,  the
              shell does  so  before
              displaying the primary
              prompt.  If this vari‐
              able  is unset, or set
              to a value that is not
              a number greater  than
              or  equal to zero, the
              shell  disables   mail
              checking.
       MAILPATH
              A colon-separated list
              of   filenames  to  be
              checked for mail.  The
              message to be  printed
              when mail arrives in a
              particular file may be
              specified  by separat‐
              ing the filename  from
              the   message  with  a
              `?'.  When used in the
              text of  the  message,
              $_ expands to the name
              of  the  current mail‐
              file.  Example:
              MAIL‐
              PATH='/var/mail/bfox?"You
              have
              mail":~/shell-mail?"$_
              has mail!"'
              Bash can be configured
              to  supply  a  default
              value  for  this vari‐
              able  (there   is   no
              value by default), but
              the  location  of  the
              user mail  files  that
              it  uses is system de‐
              pendent         (e.g.,
              /var/mail/$USER).
       OPTERR If set to the value 1,
              bash   displays  error
              messages generated  by
              the   getopts  builtin
              command   (see   SHELL
              BUILTIN  COMMANDS  be‐
              low).  OPTERR is  ini‐
              tialized   to  1  each
              time the shell is  in‐
              voked   or   a   shell
              script is executed.
       PATH   The  search  path  for
              commands.    It  is  a
              colon-separated   list
              of    directories   in
              which the shell  looks
              for commands (see COM‐
              MAND EXECUTION below).
              A  zero-length  (null)
              directory name in  the
              value  of  PATH  indi‐
              cates the current  di‐
              rectory.   A  null di‐
              rectory name  may  ap‐
              pear  as  two adjacent
              colons, or as an  ini‐
              tial    or    trailing
              colon.   The   default
              path  is system-depen‐
              dent, and  is  set  by
              the  administrator who
              installs bash.  A com‐
              mon value is
              ``/usr/local/bin:
              /usr/local/sbin:
              /usr/bin:/usr/sbin:
              /bin:/sbin''.
       POSIXLY_CORRECT
              If this variable is in
              the  environment  when
              bash starts, the shell
              enters  posix mode be‐
              fore    reading    the
              startup  files,  as if
              the --posix invocation
              option had  been  sup‐
              plied.   If  it is set
              while  the  shell   is
              running,  bash enables
              posix mode, as if  the
              command  set  -o posix
              had   been   executed.
              When  the shell enters
              posix  mode,  it  sets
              this  variable  if  it
              was not already set.
       PROMPT_COMMAND
              If  this  variable  is
              set,  and is an array,
              the value of each  set
              element is executed as
              a command prior to is‐
              suing   each   primary
              prompt.   If  this  is
              set  but  not an array
              variable, its value is
              used as a  command  to
              execute instead.
       PROMPT_DIRTRIM
              If  set  to  a  number
              greater than zero, the
              value is used  as  the
              number of trailing di‐
              rectory  components to
              retain when  expanding
              the  \w  and \W prompt
              string  escapes   (see
              PROMPTING      below).
              Characters removed are
              replaced with  an  el‐
              lipsis.
       PS0    The  value of this pa‐
              rameter  is   expanded
              (see  PROMPTING below)
              and displayed  by  in‐
              teractive shells after
              reading  a command and
              before the command  is
              executed.
       PS1    The  value of this pa‐
              rameter  is   expanded
              (see  PROMPTING below)
              and used as  the  pri‐
              mary   prompt  string.
              The default  value  is
              ``\s-\v\$ ''.
       PS2    The  value of this pa‐
              rameter is expanded as
              with PS1 and  used  as
              the  secondary  prompt
              string.   The  default
              is ``> ''.
       PS3    The  value of this pa‐
              rameter is used as the
              prompt for the  select
              command   (see   SHELL
              GRAMMAR above).
       PS4    The value of this  pa‐
              rameter is expanded as
              with PS1 and the value
              is printed before each
              command  bash displays
              during  an   execution
              trace.     The   first
              character of  the  ex‐
              panded value of PS4 is
              replicated    multiple
              times,  as  necessary,
              to  indicate  multiple
              levels of indirection.
              The default is ``+ ''.
       SHELL  This variable  expands
              to  the  full pathname
              to the shell.   If  it
              is  not  set  when the
              shell starts, bash as‐
              signs to it  the  full
              pathname  of  the cur‐
              rent   user's    login
              shell.
       TIMEFORMAT
              The  value of this pa‐
              rameter is used  as  a
              format string specify‐
              ing how the timing in‐
              formation          for
              pipelines     prefixed
              with the time reserved
              word  should  be  dis‐
              played.  The % charac‐
              ter introduces an  es‐
              cape  sequence that is
              expanded  to  a   time
              value  or other infor‐
              mation.   The   escape
              sequences   and  their
              meanings are  as  fol‐
              lows;  the  braces de‐
              note   optional   por‐
              tions.
              %%        A literal %.
              %[p][l]R  The  elapsed
                        time in sec‐
                        onds.
              %[p][l]U  The   number
                        of  CPU sec‐
                        onds   spent
                        in      user
                        mode.
              %[p][l]S  The   number
                        of  CPU sec‐
                        onds   spent
                        in    system
                        mode.
              %P        The CPU per‐
                        centage,
                        computed  as
                        (%U  + %S) /
                        %R.

              The optional  p  is  a
              digit  specifying  the
              precision, the  number
              of  fractional  digits
              after a decimal point.
              A value of 0 causes no
              decimal point or frac‐
              tion to be output.  At
              most three places  af‐
              ter  the decimal point
              may be specified; val‐
              ues of p greater  than
              3  are  changed  to 3.
              If p is not specified,
              the value 3 is used.

              The optional l  speci‐
              fies  a longer format,
              including minutes,  of
              the   form  MMmSS.FFs.
              The value of p  deter‐
              mines  whether  or not
              the  fraction  is  in‐
              cluded.

              If  this  variable  is
              not set, bash acts  as
              if  it  had  the value
              $'\nreal\t%3lR\nuser\t%3lU\nsys\t%3lS'.
              If the value is  null,
              no  timing information
              is    displayed.     A
              trailing   newline  is
              added when the  format
              string is displayed.
       TMOUT  If   set  to  a  value
              greater   than   zero,
              TMOUT  is  treated  as
              the  default   timeout
              for  the read builtin.
              The   select   command
              terminates   if  input
              does not arrive  after
              TMOUT seconds when in‐
              put  is  coming from a
              terminal.  In  an  in‐
              teractive  shell,  the
              value  is  interpreted
              as  the number of sec‐
              onds  to  wait  for  a
              line  of  input  after
              issuing  the   primary
              prompt.   Bash  termi‐
              nates  after   waiting
              for   that  number  of
              seconds if a  complete
              line of input does not
              arrive.
       TMPDIR If  set, bash uses its
              value as the name of a
              directory   in   which
              bash creates temporary
              files  for the shell's
              use.
       auto_resume
              This variable controls
              how the  shell  inter‐
              acts with the user and
              job  control.  If this
              variable is set,  sin‐
              gle  word  simple com‐
              mands without redirec‐
              tions are  treated  as
              candidates for resump‐
              tion  of  an  existing
              stopped job.  There is
              no ambiguity  allowed;
              if  there is more than
              one job beginning with
              the string typed,  the
              job  most recently ac‐
              cessed  is   selected.
              The  name of a stopped
              job, in this  context,
              is  the  command  line
              used to start it.   If
              set  to  the value ex‐
              act, the  string  sup‐
              plied  must  match the
              name of a stopped  job
              exactly;   if  set  to
              substring, the  string
              supplied    needs   to
              match a  substring  of
              the  name of a stopped
              job.   The   substring
              value  provides  func‐
              tionality analogous to
              the %?  job identifier
              (see JOB  CONTROL  be‐
              low).   If  set to any
              other value, the  sup‐
              plied string must be a
              prefix  of  a  stopped
              job's name; this  pro‐
              vides    functionality
              analogous    to    the
              %string   job  identi‐
              fier.
       histchars
              The two or three char‐
              acters  which  control
              history  expansion and
              tokenization (see HIS‐
              TORY EXPANSION below).
              The first character is
              the history  expansion
              character, the charac‐
              ter  which signals the
              start of a history ex‐
              pansion, normally `!'.
              The  second  character
              is the quick substitu‐
              tion  character, which
              is used  as  shorthand
              for   re-running   the
              previous  command  en‐
              tered,    substituting
              one string for another
              in the  command.   The
              default  is  `^'.  The
              optional third charac‐
              ter is  the  character
              which  indicates  that
              the remainder  of  the
              line is a comment when
              found   as  the  first
              character of  a  word,
              normally   `#'.    The
              history comment  char‐
              acter  causes  history
              substitution   to   be
              skipped  for  the  re‐
              maining words  on  the
              line.    It  does  not
              necessarily cause  the
              shell  parser to treat
              the rest of  the  line
              as a comment.

   Arrays
       Bash provides one-dimensional
       indexed and associative array
       variables.   Any variable may
       be used as an indexed  array;
       the  declare builtin will ex‐
       plicitly  declare  an  array.
       There  is no maximum limit on
       the size of an array, nor any
       requirement that  members  be
       indexed  or assigned contigu‐
       ously.   Indexed  arrays  are
       referenced   using   integers
       (including arithmetic expres‐
       sions)  and  are  zero-based;
       associative arrays are refer‐
       enced     using     arbitrary
       strings.   Unless   otherwise
       noted,  indexed array indices
       must  be  non-negative  inte‐
       gers.

       An  indexed  array is created
       automatically if any variable
       is assigned to using the syn‐
       tax    name[subscript]=value.
       The  subscript  is treated as
       an arithmetic expression that
       must evaluate  to  a  number.
       To  explicitly declare an in‐
       dexed array, use  declare  -a
       name  (see SHELL BUILTIN COM‐
       MANDS  below).   declare   -a
       name[subscript]  is  also ac‐
       cepted; the subscript is  ig‐
       nored.

       Associative  arrays  are cre‐
       ated using declare -A name.

       Attributes may  be  specified
       for  an  array variable using
       the  declare   and   readonly
       builtins.  Each attribute ap‐
       plies  to  all  members of an
       array.

       Arrays are assigned to  using
       compound  assignments  of the
       form  name=(value1  ...  val‐
       uen), where each value may be
       of     the     form     [sub‐
       script]=string.  Indexed  ar‐
       ray  assignments  do  not re‐
       quire  anything  but  string.
       Each value in the list is ex‐
       panded  using  all  the shell
       expansions  described   below
       under  EXPANSION.   When  as‐
       signing to indexed arrays, if
       the  optional  brackets   and
       subscript  are supplied, that
       index is assigned to;  other‐
       wise the index of the element
       assigned  is  the  last index
       assigned to by the  statement
       plus one.  Indexing starts at
       zero.

       When assigning to an associa‐
       tive  array,  the  words in a
       compound  assignment  may  be
       either assignment statements,
       for  which  the  subscript is
       required, or a list of  words
       that  is interpreted as a se‐
       quence  of  alternating  keys
       and   values:   name=(   key1
       value1  key2   value2   ...).
       These are treated identically
       to    name=(    [key1]=value1
       [key2]=value2   ...).     The
       first word in the list deter‐
       mines how the remaining words
       are  interpreted; all assign‐
       ments in a list  must  be  of
       the  same  type.   When using
       key/value pairs, the keys may
       not be missing  or  empty;  a
       final    missing   value   is
       treated   like   the    empty
       string.

       This  syntax is also accepted
       by the declare builtin.   In‐
       dividual  array  elements may
       be  assigned  to  using   the
       name[subscript]=value  syntax
       introduced above.   When  as‐
       signing  to an indexed array,
       if name is subscripted  by  a
       negative  number, that number
       is interpreted as relative to
       one greater than the  maximum
       index  of  name,  so negative
       indices count back  from  the
       end  of the array, and an in‐
       dex of -1 references the last
       element.

       The += operator  will  append
       to an array variable when as‐
       signing  using  the  compound
       assignment syntax; see  PARA‐
       METERS above.

       Any  element  of an array may
       be      referenced      using
       ${name[subscript]}.       The
       braces are required to  avoid
       conflicts  with  pathname ex‐
       pansion.  If subscript  is  @
       or *, the word expands to all
       members  of name.  These sub‐
       scripts differ only when  the
       word  appears  within  double
       quotes.  If the word is  dou‐
       ble-quoted,   ${name[*]}  ex‐
       pands to a single  word  with
       the  value of each array mem‐
       ber separated  by  the  first
       character  of the IFS special
       variable, and ${name[@]}  ex‐
       pands each element of name to
       a  separate word.  When there
       are   no    array    members,
       ${name[@]}  expands  to noth‐
       ing.   If  the  double-quoted
       expansion   occurs  within  a
       word, the  expansion  of  the
       first   parameter  is  joined
       with the  beginning  part  of
       the  original  word,  and the
       expansion of the last parame‐
       ter is joined with  the  last
       part  of  the  original word.
       This is analogous to the  ex‐
       pansion  of the special para‐
       meters * and @  (see  Special
       Parameters            above).
       ${#name[subscript]}   expands
       to  the length of ${name[sub‐
       script]}.  If subscript is  *
       or  @,  the  expansion is the
       number of elements in the ar‐
       ray.  If the  subscript  used
       to reference an element of an
       indexed  array evaluates to a
       number less than zero, it  is
       interpreted  as  relative  to
       one greater than the  maximum
       index  of the array, so nega‐
       tive indices count back  from
       the  end of the array, and an
       index of  -1  references  the
       last element.

       Referencing an array variable
       without a subscript is equiv‐
       alent  to referencing the ar‐
       ray with a  subscript  of  0.
       Any  reference  to a variable
       using a  valid  subscript  is
       legal,  and  bash will create
       an array if necessary.

       An array variable is  consid‐
       ered  set  if a subscript has
       been assigned a  value.   The
       null string is a valid value.

       It  is possible to obtain the
       keys (indices) of an array as
       well    as    the     values.
       ${!name[@]}  and  ${!name[*]}
       expand  to  the  indices  as‐
       signed   in   array  variable
       name.  The treatment when  in
       double  quotes  is similar to
       the expansion of the  special
       parameters  @  and  *  within
       double quotes.

       The unset builtin is used  to
       destroy     arrays.     unset
       name[subscript] destroys  the
       array  element  at index sub‐
       script, for both indexed  and
       associative arrays.  Negative
       subscripts  to indexed arrays
       are interpreted as  described
       above.   Unsetting  the  last
       element of an array  variable
       does  not unset the variable.
       unset name, where name is  an
       array, removes the entire ar‐
       ray.   unset name[subscript],
       where subscript is  *  or  @,
       behaves differently depending
       on whether name is an indexed
       or   associative  array.   If
       name is an associative array,
       this unsets the element  with
       subscript * or @.  If name is
       an  indexed  array, unset re‐
       moves all of the elements but
       does not remove the array it‐
       self.

       When using  a  variable  name
       with  a subscript as an argu‐
       ment to a  command,  such  as
       with unset, without using the
       word   expansion  syntax  de‐
       scribed above,  the  argument
       is subject to pathname expan‐
       sion.   If pathname expansion
       is not desired, the  argument
       should be quoted.

       The declare, local, and read‐
       only  builtins  each accept a
       -a option to specify  an  in‐
       dexed  array  and a -A option
       to specify an associative ar‐
       ray.   If  both  options  are
       supplied,   -A  takes  prece‐
       dence.  The read builtin  ac‐
       cepts a -a option to assign a
       list  of  words read from the
       standard input to  an  array.
       The  set and declare builtins
       display array values in a way
       that allows them to be reused
       as assignments.

EXPANSION
       Expansion is performed on the
       command  line  after  it  has
       been split into words.  There
       are  seven kinds of expansion
       performed:  brace  expansion,
       tilde   expansion,  parameter
       and variable expansion,  com‐
       mand substitution, arithmetic
       expansion,   word  splitting,
       and pathname expansion.

       The order of  expansions  is:
       brace expansion; tilde expan‐
       sion,  parameter and variable
       expansion, arithmetic  expan‐
       sion,  and  command substitu‐
       tion (done in a left-to-right
       fashion); word splitting; and
       pathname expansion.

       On systems that  can  support
       it,  there  is  an additional
       expansion available:  process
       substitution.   This  is per‐
       formed at the  same  time  as
       tilde,  parameter,  variable,
       and arithmetic expansion  and
       command substitution.

       After  these  expansions  are
       performed,  quote  characters
       present  in the original word
       are removed unless they  have
       been quoted themselves (quote
       removal).

       Only  brace  expansion,  word
       splitting, and  pathname  ex‐
       pansion can increase the num‐
       ber  of  words  of the expan‐
       sion; other expansions expand
       a single  word  to  a  single
       word.  The only exceptions to
       this  are  the  expansions of
       "$@" and  "${name[@]}",  and,
       in   most   cases,   $*   and
       ${name[*]} as explained above
       (see PARAMETERS).

   Brace Expansion
       Brace expansion is  a  mecha‐
       nism   by   which   arbitrary
       strings  may  be   generated.
       This  mechanism is similar to
       pathname expansion,  but  the
       filenames  generated need not
       exist.  Patterns to be  brace
       expanded  take the form of an
       optional  preamble,  followed
       by  either a series of comma-
       separated strings  or  a  se‐
       quence  expression  between a
       pair of braces,  followed  by
       an  optional postscript.  The
       preamble is prefixed to  each
       string  contained  within the
       braces, and the postscript is
       then appended to each result‐
       ing string, expanding left to
       right.

       Brace   expansions   may   be
       nested.   The results of each
       expanded   string   are   not
       sorted;  left  to right order
       is preserved.   For  example,
       a{d,c,b}e  expands  into `ade
       ace abe'.

       A sequence  expression  takes
       the    form   {x..y[..incr]},
       where x and y are either  in‐
       tegers or single letters, and
       incr,  an optional increment,
       is an integer.  When integers
       are supplied, the  expression
       expands  to  each  number be‐
       tween  x  and  y,  inclusive.
       Supplied integers may be pre‐
       fixed  with  0  to force each
       term to have the same  width.
       When  either  x  or  y begins
       with a zero,  the  shell  at‐
       tempts to force all generated
       terms  to  contain  the  same
       number   of   digits,   zero-
       padding    where   necessary.
       When  letters  are  supplied,
       the   expression  expands  to
       each character  lexicographi‐
       cally between x and y, inclu‐
       sive, using the default C lo‐
       cale.  Note that both x and y
       must be of the same type (in‐
       teger  or  letter).  When the
       increment is supplied, it  is
       used  as  the  difference be‐
       tween each term.  The default
       increment is 1 or -1  as  ap‐
       propriate.

       Brace  expansion is performed
       before any other  expansions,
       and any characters special to
       other   expansions  are  pre‐
       served in the result.  It  is
       strictly  textual.  Bash does
       not apply any  syntactic  in‐
       terpretation  to  the context
       of the expansion or the  text
       between the braces.

       A  correctly-formed brace ex‐
       pansion must contain unquoted
       opening and  closing  braces,
       and  at  least  one  unquoted
       comma or a valid sequence ex‐
       pression.   Any   incorrectly
       formed   brace  expansion  is
       left unchanged.  A { or , may
       be quoted with a backslash to
       prevent its being  considered
       part  of  a brace expression.
       To avoid conflicts with para‐
       meter expansion,  the  string
       ${ is not considered eligible
       for  brace expansion, and in‐
       hibits brace expansion  until
       the closing }.

       This  construct  is typically
       used as  shorthand  when  the
       common  prefix of the strings
       to  be  generated  is  longer
       than in the above example:

              mkdir         /usr/lo‐
              cal/src/bash/{old,new,dist,bugs}
       or
              chown             root
              /usr/{ucb/{ex,edit},lib/{ex?.?*,how_ex}}

       Brace  expansion introduces a
       slight  incompatibility  with
       historical  versions  of  sh.
       sh does not treat opening  or
       closing braces specially when
       they  appear  as  part  of  a
       word, and preserves  them  in
       the   output.   Bash  removes
       braces from words as a conse‐
       quence  of  brace  expansion.
       For  example,  a word entered
       to sh  as  file{1,2}  appears
       identically  in  the  output.
       The same word  is  output  as
       file1  file2  after expansion
       by bash.  If strict  compati‐
       bility  with  sh  is desired,
       start bash with the +B option
       or  disable  brace  expansion
       with the +B option to the set
       command  (see  SHELL  BUILTIN
       COMMANDS below).

   Tilde Expansion
       If a word begins with an  un‐
       quoted tilde character (`~'),
       all of the characters preced‐
       ing  the first unquoted slash
       (or all characters, if  there
       is  no  unquoted  slash)  are
       considered  a   tilde-prefix.
       If  none of the characters in
       the tilde-prefix are  quoted,
       the  characters in the tilde-
       prefix  following  the  tilde
       are treated as a possible lo‐
       gin name.  If this login name
       is the null string, the tilde
       is replaced with the value of
       the shell parameter HOME.  If
       HOME  is  unset, the home di‐
       rectory of the user executing
       the shell is substituted  in‐
       stead.  Otherwise, the tilde-
       prefix  is  replaced with the
       home   directory   associated
       with   the   specified  login
       name.

       If  the  tilde-prefix  is   a
       `~+',  the value of the shell
       variable  PWD  replaces   the
       tilde-prefix.   If the tilde-
       prefix is a `~-',  the  value
       of the shell variable OLDPWD,
       if it is set, is substituted.
       If  the  characters following
       the tilde in the tilde-prefix
       consist of a  number  N,  op‐
       tionally prefixed by a `+' or
       a  `-',  the  tilde-prefix is
       replaced with the correspond‐
       ing element from  the  direc‐
       tory  stack,  as  it would be
       displayed by the dirs builtin
       invoked with the tilde-prefix
       as an argument.  If the char‐
       acters following the tilde in
       the tilde-prefix consist of a
       number without a leading  `+'
       or `-', `+' is assumed.

       If the login name is invalid,
       or the tilde expansion fails,
       the word is unchanged.

       Each  variable  assignment is
       checked for  unquoted  tilde-
       prefixes  immediately follow‐
       ing a : or the first  =.   In
       these  cases, tilde expansion
       is  also  performed.   Conse‐
       quently,  one  may  use file‐
       names with tildes in  assign‐
       ments  to PATH, MAILPATH, and
       CDPATH, and the shell assigns
       the expanded value.

       Bash also performs tilde  ex‐
       pansion  on  words satisfying
       the  conditions  of  variable
       assignments   (as   described
       above under PARAMETERS)  when
       they  appear  as arguments to
       simple commands.   Bash  does
       not  do  this, except for the
       declaration  commands  listed
       above, when in posix mode.

   Parameter Expansion
       The  `$' character introduces
       parameter expansion,  command
       substitution,  or  arithmetic
       expansion.    The   parameter
       name or symbol to be expanded
       may  be  enclosed  in braces,
       which are optional but  serve
       to protect the variable to be
       expanded  from characters im‐
       mediately following it  which
       could  be interpreted as part
       of the name.

       When  braces  are  used,  the
       matching  ending brace is the
       first `}' not  escaped  by  a
       backslash  or within a quoted
       string, and not within an em‐
       bedded arithmetic  expansion,
       command  substitution, or pa‐
       rameter expansion.

       ${parameter}
              The value of parameter
              is  substituted.   The
              braces   are  required
              when  parameter  is  a
              positional   parameter
              with  more  than   one
              digit, or when parame‐
              ter  is  followed by a
              character which is not
              to be  interpreted  as
              part of its name.  The
              parameter  is  a shell
              parameter as described
              above  PARAMETERS)  or
              an   array   reference
              (Arrays).

       If the first character of pa‐
       rameter  is  an   exclamation
       point  (!),  and parameter is
       not a nameref, it  introduces
       a level of indirection.  Bash
       uses  the value formed by ex‐
       panding the rest of parameter
       as the new parameter; this is
       then expanded and that  value
       is  used  in  the rest of the
       expansion,  rather  than  the
       expansion of the original pa‐
       rameter.   This  is  known as
       indirect   expansion.     The
       value is subject to tilde ex‐
       pansion, parameter expansion,
       command   substitution,   and
       arithmetic expansion.  If pa‐
       rameter is  a  nameref,  this
       expands  to  the  name of the
       parameter referenced by para‐
       meter instead  of  performing
       the  complete indirect expan‐
       sion.  The exceptions to this
       are the expansions of ${!pre‐
       fix*}  and  ${!name[@]}   de‐
       scribed  below.  The exclama‐
       tion point  must  immediately
       follow  the left brace in or‐
       der to introduce indirection.

       In each of the  cases  below,
       word  is subject to tilde ex‐
       pansion, parameter expansion,
       command   substitution,   and
       arithmetic expansion.

       When not performing substring
       expansion,  using  the  forms
       documented below (e.g.,  :-),
       bash  tests  for  a parameter
       that is unset or null.  Omit‐
       ting the colon results  in  a
       test  only  for  a  parameter
       that is unset.

       ${parameter:-word}
              Use  Default   Values.
              If  parameter is unset
              or null, the expansion
              of  word  is   substi‐
              tuted.  Otherwise, the
              value  of parameter is
              substituted.
       ${parameter:=word}
              Assign Default Values.
              If parameter is  unset
              or null, the expansion
              of word is assigned to
              parameter.   The value
              of parameter  is  then
              substituted.     Posi‐
              tional parameters  and
              special parameters may
              not  be assigned to in
              this way.
       ${parameter:?word}
              Display Error if  Null
              or  Unset.  If parame‐
              ter is null or  unset,
              the  expansion of word
              (or a message to  that
              effect  if word is not
              present) is written to
              the standard error and
              the shell,  if  it  is
              not  interactive,  ex‐
              its.   Otherwise,  the
              value  of parameter is
              substituted.
       ${parameter:+word}
              Use  Alternate  Value.
              If  parameter  is null
              or unset,  nothing  is
              substituted, otherwise
              the  expansion of word
              is substituted.
       ${parameter:offset}
       ${parameter:offset:length}
              Substring   Expansion.
              Expands   to   up   to
              length  characters  of
              the value of parameter
              starting  at the char‐
              acter   specified   by
              offset.   If parameter
              is @ or *, an  indexed
              array subscripted by @
              or  *,  or an associa‐
              tive array  name,  the
              results  differ as de‐
              scribed   below.    If
              length is omitted, ex‐
              pands to the substring
              of  the value of para‐
              meter starting at  the
              character specified by
              offset  and  extending
              to  the  end  of   the
              value.    length   and
              offset are  arithmetic
              expressions       (see
              ARITHMETIC  EVALUATION
              below).

              If offset evaluates to
              a   number  less  than
              zero,  the  value   is
              used  as  an offset in
              characters  from   the
              end  of  the  value of
              parameter.  If  length
              evaluates  to a number
              less than zero, it  is
              interpreted as an off‐
              set in characters from
              the  end  of the value
              of  parameter   rather
              than a number of char‐
              acters, and the expan‐
              sion is the characters
              between   offset   and
              that   result.    Note
              that a negative offset
              must be separated from
              the  colon by at least
              one space to avoid be‐
              ing confused with  the
              :- expansion.

              If  parameter  is @ or
              *,   the   result   is
              length  positional pa‐
              rameters beginning  at
              offset.    A  negative
              offset is taken  rela‐
              tive  to  one  greater
              than the greatest  po‐
              sitional parameter, so
              an offset of -1 evalu‐
              ates to the last posi‐
              tional  parameter.  It
              is an expansion  error
              if length evaluates to
              a   number  less  than
              zero.

              If parameter is an in‐
              dexed array name  sub‐
              scripted  by  @  or *,
              the  result   is   the
              length  members of the
              array  beginning  with
              ${parameter[offset]}.
              A  negative  offset is
              taken relative to  one
              greater than the maxi‐
              mum index of the spec‐
              ified array.  It is an
              expansion   error   if
              length evaluates to  a
              number less than zero.

              Substring    expansion
              applied to an associa‐
              tive  array   produces
              undefined results.

              Substring  indexing is
              zero-based unless  the
              positional  parameters
              are  used,  in   which
              case    the   indexing
              starts  at  1  by  de‐
              fault.   If  offset is
              0, and the  positional
              parameters  are  used,
              $0 is prefixed to  the
              list.

       ${!prefix*}
       ${!prefix@}
              Names matching prefix.
              Expands  to  the names
              of   variables   whose
              names  begin with pre‐
              fix, separated by  the
              first character of the
              IFS  special variable.
              When @ is used and the
              expansion      appears
              within  double quotes,
              each variable name ex‐
              pands  to  a  separate
              word.

       ${!name[@]}
       ${!name[*]}
              List  of  array  keys.
              If name  is  an  array
              variable,  expands  to
              the list of array  in‐
              dices  (keys) assigned
              in name.  If  name  is
              not  an array, expands
              to 0 if  name  is  set
              and   null  otherwise.
              When @ is used and the
              expansion      appears
              within  double quotes,
              each key expands to  a
              separate word.

       ${#parameter}
              Parameter length.  The
              length  in  characters
              of the value of  para‐
              meter  is substituted.
              If parameter is  *  or
              @,  the  value substi‐
              tuted is the number of
              positional parameters.
              If parameter is an ar‐
              ray  name  subscripted
              by  *  or @, the value
              substituted   is   the
              number  of elements in
              the array.  If parame‐
              ter is an indexed  ar‐
              ray  name  subscripted
              by a negative  number,
              that  number is inter‐
              preted as relative  to
              one  greater  than the
              maximum index of para‐
              meter, so negative in‐
              dices count back  from
              the  end of the array,
              and  an  index  of  -1
              references   the  last
              element.

       ${parameter#word}
       ${parameter##word}
              Remove matching prefix
              pattern.  The word  is
              expanded  to produce a
              pattern  just  as   in
              pathname    expansion,
              and  matched   against
              the  expanded value of
              parameter  using   the
              rules  described under
              Pattern  Matching  be‐
              low.   If  the pattern
              matches the  beginning
              of  the value of para‐
              meter, then the result
              of  the  expansion  is
              the  expanded value of
              parameter   with   the
              shortest matching pat‐
              tern  (the ``#'' case)
              or the longest  match‐
              ing    pattern    (the
              ``##'' case)  deleted.
              If  parameter  is @ or
              *, the pattern removal
              operation  is  applied
              to each positional pa‐
              rameter  in  turn, and
              the expansion  is  the
              resultant   list.   If
              parameter is an  array
              variable   subscripted
              with @ or *, the  pat‐
              tern removal operation
              is   applied  to  each
              member of the array in
              turn, and  the  expan‐
              sion  is the resultant
              list.

       ${parameter%word}
       ${parameter%%word}
              Remove matching suffix
              pattern.  The word  is
              expanded  to produce a
              pattern  just  as   in
              pathname    expansion,
              and  matched   against
              the  expanded value of
              parameter  using   the
              rules  described under
              Pattern  Matching  be‐
              low.   If  the pattern
              matches   a   trailing
              portion   of  the  ex‐
              panded value of  para‐
              meter, then the result
              of  the  expansion  is
              the expanded value  of
              parameter   with   the
              shortest matching pat‐
              tern (the ``%''  case)
              or  the longest match‐
              ing    pattern    (the
              ``%%''  case) deleted.
              If parameter is  @  or
              *, the pattern removal
              operation  is  applied
              to each positional pa‐
              rameter in  turn,  and
              the  expansion  is the
              resultant  list.    If
              parameter  is an array
              variable   subscripted
              with  @ or *, the pat‐
              tern removal operation
              is  applied  to   each
              member of the array in
              turn,  and  the expan‐
              sion is the  resultant
              list.

       ${parameter/pattern/string}
       ${parameter//pattern/string}
       ${parameter/#pattern/string}
       ${parameter/%pattern/string}
              Pattern  substitution.
              The  pattern  is   ex‐
              panded  to  produce  a
              pattern  just  as   in
              pathname    expansion.
              Parameter is  expanded
              and  the longest match
              of pattern against its
              value is replaced with
              string.  string under‐
              goes tilde  expansion,
              parameter and variable
              expansion,  arithmetic
              expansion, command and
              process  substitution,
              and   quote   removal.
              The match is performed
              using  the  rules  de‐
              scribed  under Pattern
              Matching  below.    In
              the  first form above,
              only the  first  match
              is replaced.  If there
              are  two slashes sepa‐
              rating  parameter  and
              pattern   (the  second
              form    above),    all
              matches of pattern are
              replaced  with string.
              If pattern is preceded
              by # (the  third  form
              above),  it must match
              at  the  beginning  of
              the  expanded value of
              parameter.  If pattern
              is preceded by %  (the
              fourth form above), it
              must  match at the end
              of the expanded  value
              of  parameter.  If the
              expansion of string is
              null, matches of  pat‐
              tern  are deleted.  If
              string    is     null,
              matches of pattern are
              deleted and the / fol‐
              lowing  pattern may be
              omitted.

              If the patsub_replace‐
              ment shell  option  is
              enabled  using  shopt,
              any unquoted instances
              of & in string are re‐
              placed with the match‐
              ing  portion  of  pat‐
              tern.

              Quoting  any  part  of
              string  inhibits   re‐
              placement  in  the ex‐
              pansion of the  quoted
              portion, including re‐
              placement      strings
              stored in shell  vari‐
              ables.  Backslash will
              escape  &  in  string;
              the backslash  is  re‐
              moved in order to per‐
              mit a literal & in the
              replacement    string.
              Backslash can also  be
              used to escape a back‐
              slash; \\ results in a
              literal  backslash  in
              the       replacement.
              Users should take care
              if  string  is double-
              quoted  to  avoid  un‐
              wanted    interactions
              between the  backslash
              and    double-quoting,
              since  backslash   has
              special meaning within
              double  quotes.   Pat‐
              tern substitution per‐
              forms  the  check  for
              unquoted  &  after ex‐
              panding string;  shell
              programmers     should
              quote any  occurrences
              of  &  they want to be
              taken literally in the
              replacement and ensure
              any  instances  of   &
              they  want  to  be re‐
              placed are unquoted.

              If   the   nocasematch
              shell  option  is  en‐
              abled,  the  match  is
              performed  without re‐
              gard to  the  case  of
              alphabetic characters.
              If  parameter  is @ or
              *,  the   substitution
              operation  is  applied
              to each positional pa‐
              rameter in  turn,  and
              the  expansion  is the
              resultant  list.    If
              parameter  is an array
              variable   subscripted
              with  @ or *, the sub‐
              stitution operation is
              applied to each member
              of the array in  turn,
              and  the  expansion is
              the resultant list.

       ${parameter^pattern}
       ${parameter^^pattern}
       ${parameter,pattern}
       ${parameter,,pattern}
              Case     modification.
              This  expansion  modi‐
              fies the case  of  al‐
              phabetic characters in
              parameter.   The  pat‐
              tern  is  expanded  to
              produce a pattern just
              as  in pathname expan‐
              sion.  Each  character
              in  the expanded value
              of parameter is tested
              against pattern,  and,
              if it matches the pat‐
              tern, its case is con‐
              verted.   The  pattern
              should not attempt  to
              match  more  than  one
              character.  The ^  op‐
              erator converts lower‐
              case  letters matching
              pattern to  uppercase;
              the  ,  operator  con‐
              verts matching  upper‐
              case letters to lower‐
              case.   The  ^^ and ,,
              expansions     convert
              each matched character
              in the expanded value;
              the ^ and , expansions
              match and convert only
              the first character in
              the   expanded  value.
              If pattern is omitted,
              it is treated  like  a
              ?, which matches every
              character.  If parame‐
              ter  is  @  or  *, the
              case modification  op‐
              eration  is applied to
              each positional  para‐
              meter in turn, and the
              expansion  is  the re‐
              sultant list.  If  pa‐
              rameter  is  an  array
              variable   subscripted
              with  @ or *, the case
              modification operation
              is  applied  to   each
              member of the array in
              turn,  and  the expan‐
              sion is the  resultant
              list.

       ${parameter@operator}
              Parameter  transforma‐
              tion.   The  expansion
              is  either a transfor‐
              mation of the value of
              parameter or  informa‐
              tion  about  parameter
              itself,  depending  on
              the value of operator.
              Each   operator  is  a

                     flag     values
                     representing

                     tributes.
              k      Like    the   K

                     ter word split‐
                     ting.

              If  parameter  is @ or
              *,  the  operation  is
              applied  to each posi‐
              tional  parameter   in
              turn,  and  the expan‐
              sion is the  resultant
              list.  If parameter is
              an array variable sub‐
              scripted  with @ or *,
              the operation  is  ap‐
              plied  to  each member
              of the array in  turn,
              and  the  expansion is
              the resultant list.

              The result of the  ex‐
              pansion  is subject to
              word   splitting   and
              pathname  expansion as
              described below.

   Command Substitution
       Command  substitution  allows
       the  output  of  a command to
       replace  the  command   name.
       There are two forms:

              $(command)
       or
              `command`

       Bash  performs  the expansion
       by  executing  command  in  a
       subshell  environment and re‐
       placing the command substitu‐
       tion with the standard output
       of  the  command,  with   any
       trailing   newlines  deleted.
       Embedded  newlines  are   not
       deleted,  but they may be re‐
       moved during word  splitting.
       The    command   substitution
       $(cat file) can  be  replaced
       by  the equivalent but faster
       $(< file).

       When the old-style  backquote
       form of substitution is used,
       backslash retains its literal
       meaning  except when followed
       by $, `,  or  \.   The  first
       backquote  not  preceded by a
       backslash terminates the com‐
       mand substitution.  When  us‐
       ing  the $(command) form, all
       characters between the paren‐
       theses make up  the  command;
       none are treated specially.

       Command  substitutions may be
       nested.  To nest  when  using
       the  backquoted  form, escape
       the  inner  backquotes   with
       backslashes.

       If  the  substitution appears
       within  double  quotes,  word
       splitting and pathname expan‐
       sion are not performed on the
       results.

   Arithmetic Expansion
       Arithmetic  expansion  allows
       the evaluation of  an  arith‐
       metic expression and the sub‐
       stitution of the result.  The
       format  for arithmetic expan‐
       sion is:

              $((expression))

       The old format  $[expression]
       is deprecated and will be re‐
       moved in upcoming versions of
       bash.

       The  expression undergoes the
       same expansions as if it were
       within  double  quotes,   but
       double  quote  characters  in
       expression  are  not  treated
       specially  and  are  removed.
       All tokens in the  expression
       undergo  parameter  and vari‐
       able expansion, command  sub‐
       stitution, and quote removal.
       The  result is treated as the
       arithmetic expression  to  be
       evaluated.  Arithmetic expan‐
       sions may be nested.

       The  evaluation  is performed
       according to the rules listed
       below under ARITHMETIC EVALU‐
       ATION.  If expression is  in‐
       valid,  bash prints a message
       indicating  failure  and   no
       substitution occurs.

   Process Substitution
       Process substitution allows a
       process's  input or output to
       be referred to using a  file‐
       name.   It  takes the form of
       <(list)  or   >(list).    The
       process list is run asynchro‐
       nously, and its input or out‐
       put  appears  as  a filename.
       This filename is passed as an
       argument to the current  com‐
       mand as the result of the ex‐
       pansion.  If the >(list) form
       is  used, writing to the file
       will provide input for  list.
       If  the <(list) form is used,
       the file passed as  an  argu‐
       ment should be read to obtain
       the  output of list.  Process
       substitution is supported  on
       systems  that  support  named
       pipes (FIFOs) or the  /dev/fd
       method of naming open files.

       When  available, process sub‐
       stitution is performed simul‐
       taneously with parameter  and
       variable  expansion,  command
       substitution, and  arithmetic
       expansion.

   Word Splitting
       The  shell  scans the results
       of parameter expansion,  com‐
       mand substitution, and arith‐
       metic  expansion that did not
       occur  within  double  quotes
       for word splitting.

       The shell treats each charac‐
       ter  of  IFS  as a delimiter,
       and splits the results of the
       other expansions  into  words
       using   these  characters  as
       field terminators.  If IFS is
       unset, or its  value  is  ex‐
       actly  <space><tab><newline>,
       the default,  then  sequences
       of  <space>, <tab>, and <new‐
       line> at  the  beginning  and
       end  of  the  results  of the
       previous expansions  are  ig‐
       nored,  and  any  sequence of
       IFS characters not at the be‐
       ginning or end serves to  de‐
       limit  words.   If  IFS has a
       value other than the default,
       then sequences of the  white‐
       space  characters space, tab,
       and newline  are  ignored  at
       the  beginning and end of the
       word, as long as  the  white‐
       space  character  is  in  the
       value of IFS (an  IFS  white‐
       space  character).  Any char‐
       acter in IFS that is not  IFS
       whitespace,  along  with  any
       adjacent IFS whitespace char‐
       acters, delimits a field.   A
       sequence  of  IFS  whitespace
       characters is also treated as
       a delimiter.  If the value of
       IFS is null, no  word  split‐
       ting occurs.

       Explicit  null  arguments (""
       or  '')  are   retained   and
       passed  to  commands as empty
       strings.   Unquoted  implicit
       null   arguments,   resulting
       from the expansion of parame‐
       ters that have no values, are
       removed.  If a parameter with
       no value is  expanded  within
       double  quotes,  a null argu‐
       ment results and is  retained
       and passed to a command as an
       empty  string.  When a quoted
       null argument appears as part
       of a word whose expansion  is
       non-null,  the  null argument
       is  removed.   That  is,  the
       word  -d''  becomes  -d after
       word splitting and null argu‐
       ment removal.

       Note that if no expansion oc‐
       curs, no  splitting  is  per‐
       formed.

   Pathname Expansion
       After  word splitting, unless
       the -f option has  been  set,
       bash  scans each word for the
       characters *, ?, and  [.   If
       one  of  these characters ap‐
       pears,  and  is  not  quoted,
       then  the word is regarded as
       a pattern, and replaced  with
       an alphabetically sorted list
       of   filenames  matching  the
       pattern (see Pattern Matching
       below).  If no matching file‐
       names  are  found,  and   the
       shell  option nullglob is not
       enabled, the word is left un‐
       changed.  If the nullglob op‐
       tion is set, and  no  matches
       are  found,  the  word is re‐
       moved.  If the failglob shell
       option is set, and no matches
       are found, an  error  message
       is printed and the command is
       not  executed.   If the shell
       option nocaseglob is enabled,
       the match is performed  with‐
       out regard to the case of al‐
       phabetic   characters.   Note
       that when using range expres‐
       sions like [a-z] (see below),
       letters of the other case may
       be included, depending on the
       setting of LC_COLLATE.   When
       a  pattern  is used for path‐
       name expansion, the character
       ``.''  at the start of a name
       or  immediately  following  a
       slash must be matched explic‐
       itly, unless the shell option
       dotglob  is set.  In order to
       match  the  filenames   ``.''
       and  ``..'', the pattern must
       begin with ``.''  (for  exam‐
       ple, ``.?''), even if dotglob
       is  set.  If the globskipdots
       shell option is enabled,  the
       filenames  ``.''   and ``..''
       are never  matched,  even  if
       the  pattern  begins  with  a
       ``.''.   When  not   matching
       pathnames, the ``.''  charac‐
       ter is not treated specially.
       When matching a pathname, the
       slash  character  must always
       be matched  explicitly  by  a
       slash  in the pattern, but in
       other  matching  contexts  it
       can  be  matched by a special
       pattern  character   as   de‐
       scribed  below  under Pattern
       Matching.  See  the  descrip‐
       tion  of  shopt  below  under
       SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS for  a
       description  of  the  nocase‐
       glob, nullglob, globskipdots,
       failglob, and  dotglob  shell
       options.

       The GLOBIGNORE shell variable
       may  be  used to restrict the
       set of file names matching  a
       pattern.   If  GLOBIGNORE  is
       set, each matching file  name
       that  also matches one of the
       patterns in GLOBIGNORE is re‐
       moved  from   the   list   of
       matches.   If  the nocaseglob
       option is set,  the  matching
       against  the patterns in GLO‐
       BIGNORE is performed  without
       regard  to  case.   The file‐
       names ``.''  and ``..''   are
       always  ignored  when GLOBIG‐
       NORE is  set  and  not  null.
       However,  setting  GLOBIGNORE
       to a non-null value  has  the
       effect  of  enabling the dot‐
       glob  shell  option,  so  all
       other   filenames   beginning
       with a ``.''  will match.  To
       get the old behavior  of  ig‐
       noring   filenames  beginning
       with  a  ``.'',  make  ``.*''
       one  of  the patterns in GLO‐
       BIGNORE.  The dotglob  option
       is  disabled  when GLOBIGNORE
       is unset.  The pattern match‐
       ing honors the setting of the
       extglob shell option.

       Pattern Matching

       Any character that appears in
       a  pattern,  other  than  the
       special   pattern  characters
       described below, matches  it‐
       self.   The NUL character may
       not occur in  a  pattern.   A
       backslash escapes the follow‐
       ing  character;  the escaping
       backslash is  discarded  when
       matching.   The  special pat‐
       tern   characters   must   be
       quoted  if  they  are  to  be
       matched literally.

       The special  pattern  charac‐
       ters have the following mean‐
       ings:

              *      Matches     any
                     string, includ‐
                     ing  the   null
                     string.    When
                     the    globstar
                     shell option is
                     enabled,  and *
                     is  used  in  a
                     pathname expan‐
                     sion   context,
                     two adjacent *s
                     used as a  sin‐
                     gle     pattern
                     will match  all
                     files  and zero
                     or more  direc‐
                     tories and sub‐
                     directories.
                     If  followed by
                     a /, two  adja‐
                     cent   *s  will
                     match only  di‐
                     rectories   and
                     subdirectories.
              ?      Matches     any
                     single  charac‐
                     ter.
              [...]  Matches any one
                     of the enclosed
                     characters.   A
                     pair of charac‐
                     ters  separated

                     expression; any
                     character  that
                     falls   between

                     set,         is
                     matched.     If
                     the first char‐
                     acter following
                     the [  is  a  !

                     character

                     an  equivalence

                     the same colla‐
                     tion weight (as
                     defined  by the
                     current locale)
                     as the  charac‐
                     ter c.

                     Within [ and ],
                     the      syntax
                     [.symbol.]
                     matches     the
                     collating  sym‐
                     bol symbol.

       If the extglob  shell  option
       is  enabled  using  the shopt
       builtin, the shell recognizes
       several   extended    pattern
       matching  operators.   In the
       following description, a pat‐
       tern-list is a list of one or
       more patterns separated by  a
       |.  Composite patterns may be
       formed  using  one or more of
       the following sub-patterns:

              ?(pattern-list)
                     Matches zero or
                     one  occurrence
                     of   the  given
                     patterns
              *(pattern-list)
                     Matches zero or
                     more     occur‐
                     rences  of  the
                     given patterns
              +(pattern-list)
                     Matches one  or
                     more     occur‐
                     rences  of  the
                     given patterns
              @(pattern-list)
                     Matches  one of
                     the given  pat‐
                     terns
              !(pattern-list)
                     Matches    any‐
                     thing    except
                     one    of   the
                     given patterns

       Theextglob option changes the
       behavior of the parser, since
       the parentheses are  normally
       treated   as  operators  with
       syntactic meaning.  To ensure
       that extended  matching  pat‐
       terns  are  parsed correctly,
       make sure that extglob is en‐
       abled  before  parsing   con‐
       structs  containing  the pat‐
       terns, including shell  func‐
       tions  and  command substitu‐
       tions.

       When matching filenames,  the
       dotglob  shell  option deter‐
       mines the  set  of  filenames
       that are tested: when dotglob
       is  enabled, the set of file‐
       names includes all files  be‐
       ginning with ``.'', but ``.''
       and ``..'' must be matched by
       a pattern or sub-pattern that
       begins with a dot; when it is
       disabled,  the  set  does not
       include any filenames  begin‐
       ning  with  ``.''  unless the
       pattern or sub-pattern begins
       with  a  ``.''.   As   above,
       ``.''   only  has  a  special
       meaning when  matching  file‐
       names.

       Complicated  extended pattern
       matching against long strings
       is slow, especially when  the
       patterns contain alternations
       and  the strings contain mul‐
       tiple matches.   Using  sepa‐
       rate  matches against shorter
       strings, or using  arrays  of
       strings  instead  of a single
       long string, may be faster.

   Quote Removal
       After  the  preceding  expan‐
       sions,  all  unquoted  occur‐
       rences of the  characters  \,
       ',  and " that did not result
       from one of the above  expan‐
       sions are removed.

REDIRECTION
       Before a command is executed,
       its  input  and output may be
       redirected  using  a  special
       notation  interpreted  by the
       shell.   Redirection   allows
       commands'  file handles to be
       duplicated,  opened,  closed,
       made  to  refer  to different
       files,  and  can  change  the
       files  the command reads from
       and writes  to.   Redirection
       may  also  be  used to modify
       file handles in  the  current
       shell  execution environment.
       The following redirection op‐
       erators may precede or appear
       anywhere within a simple com‐
       mand or may follow a command.
       Redirections are processed in
       the order they  appear,  from
       left to right.

       Each  redirection that may be
       preceded by a file descriptor
       number may  instead  be  pre‐
       ceded  by  a word of the form
       {varname}.  In this case, for
       each redirection operator ex‐
       cept >&- and <&-,  the  shell
       will allocate a file descrip‐
       tor  greater than or equal to
       10 and assign it to  varname.
       If  >&- or <&- is preceded by
       {varname}, the value of  var‐
       name  defines  the  file  de‐
       scriptor to close.  If  {var‐
       name}  is supplied, the redi‐
       rection persists  beyond  the
       scope  of the command, allow‐
       ing the shell  programmer  to
       manage  the file descriptor's
       lifetime    manually.     The
       varredir_close  shell  option
       manages this behavior.

       In  the  following   descrip‐
       tions, if the file descriptor
       number  is  omitted,  and the
       first character of the  redi‐
       rection  operator  is  <, the
       redirection  refers  to   the
       standard input (file descrip‐
       tor 0).  If the first charac‐
       ter of the redirection opera‐
       tor  is  >,  the  redirection
       refers to the standard output
       (file descriptor 1).

       The word following the  redi‐
       rection  operator in the fol‐
       lowing  descriptions,  unless
       otherwise noted, is subjected
       to brace expansion, tilde ex‐
       pansion,  parameter and vari‐
       able expansion, command  sub‐
       stitution,  arithmetic expan‐
       sion, quote removal, pathname
       expansion,  and  word  split‐
       ting.   If it expands to more
       than one word,  bash  reports
       an error.

       Note  that the order of redi‐
       rections is significant.  For
       example, the command

              ls > dirlist 2>&1

       directs both standard  output
       and  standard  error  to  the
       file dirlist, while the  com‐
       mand

              ls 2>&1 > dirlist

       directs   only  the  standard
       output to file  dirlist,  be‐
       cause  the standard error was
       duplicated from the  standard
       output  before  the  standard
       output  was   redirected   to
       dirlist.

       Bash  handles  several  file‐
       names specially when they are
       used in redirections, as  de‐
       scribed  in the following ta‐
       ble.  If the operating system
       on which bash is running pro‐
       vides  these  special  files,
       bash will use them; otherwise
       it  will  emulate them inter‐
       nally with the  behavior  de‐
       scribed below.

              /dev/fd/fd
                     If   fd   is  a
                     valid  integer,
                     file descriptor
                     fd   is  dupli‐
                     cated.
              /dev/stdin
                     File descriptor
                     0   is   dupli‐
                     cated.
              /dev/stdout
                     File descriptor
                     1   is   dupli‐
                     cated.
              /dev/stderr
                     File descriptor
                     2   is   dupli‐
                     cated.
              /dev/tcp/host/port
                     If  host  is  a
                     valid  hostname
                     or Internet ad‐
                     dress, and port
                     is  an  integer
                     port number  or
                     service   name,
                     bash   attempts
                     to   open   the
                     corresponding
                     TCP socket.
              /dev/udp/host/port
                     If  host  is  a
                     valid  hostname
                     or Internet ad‐
                     dress, and port
                     is  an  integer
                     port  number or
                     service   name,
                     bash   attempts
                     to   open   the
                     corresponding
                     UDP socket.

       A failure to open or create a
       file  causes  the redirection
       to fail.

       Redirections using  file  de‐
       scriptors   greater   than  9
       should be used with care,  as
       they  may  conflict with file
       descriptors  the  shell  uses
       internally.

       Note  that  the  exec builtin
       command can make redirections
       take effect  in  the  current
       shell.

   Redirecting Input
       Redirection  of  input causes
       the file whose  name  results
       from the expansion of word to
       be opened for reading on file
       descriptor n, or the standard
       input  (file descriptor 0) if
       n is not specified.

       The general format for  redi‐
       recting input is:

              [n]<word

   Redirecting Output
       Redirection  of output causes
       the file whose  name  results
       from the expansion of word to
       be opened for writing on file
       descriptor n, or the standard
       output (file descriptor 1) if
       n  is  not specified.  If the
       file does  not  exist  it  is
       created;  if it does exist it
       is truncated to zero size.

       The general format for  redi‐
       recting output is:

              [n]>word

       If  the  redirection operator
       is >, and the  noclobber  op‐
       tion  to  the set builtin has
       been enabled, the redirection
       will fail if the  file  whose
       name  results from the expan‐
       sion of word exists and is  a
       regular  file.   If the redi‐
       rection operator  is  >|,  or
       the redirection operator is >
       and  the  noclobber option to
       the set  builtin  command  is
       not  enabled, the redirection
       is attempted even if the file
       named by word exists.

   Appending Redirected Output
       Redirection of output in this
       fashion causes the file whose
       name results from the  expan‐
       sion of word to be opened for
       appending  on file descriptor
       n,  or  the  standard  output
       (file  descriptor  1) if n is
       not specified.  If  the  file
       does not exist it is created.

       The  general  format  for ap‐
       pending output is:

              [n]>>word

   Redirecting Standard  Output  and
       Standard Error
       This  construct  allows  both
       the standard output (file de‐
       scriptor 1) and the  standard
       error output (file descriptor
       2)  to  be  redirected to the
       file whose name is the expan‐
       sion of word.

       There  are  two  formats  for
       redirecting  standard  output
       and standard error:

              &>word
       and
              >&word

       Of the two forms,  the  first
       is preferred.  This is seman‐
       tically equivalent to

              >word 2>&1

       When  using  the second form,
       word may not expand to a num‐
       ber or -.  If it does,  other
       redirection  operators  apply
       (see  Duplicating  File   De‐
       scriptors below) for compati‐
       bility reasons.

   Appending   Standard  Output  and
       Standard Error
       This  construct  allows  both
       the standard output (file de‐
       scriptor  1) and the standard
       error output (file descriptor
       2) to be appended to the file
       whose name is  the  expansion
       of word.

       The   format   for  appending
       standard output and  standard
       error is:

              &>>word

       This  is semantically equiva‐
       lent to

              >>word 2>&1

       (see  Duplicating  File   De‐
       scriptors below).

   Here Documents
       This  type of redirection in‐
       structs the shell to read in‐
       put from the  current  source
       until  a line containing only
       delimiter (with  no  trailing
       blanks)  is seen.  All of the
       lines read up to  that  point
       are then used as the standard
       input  (or  file descriptor n
       if n is specified) for a com‐
       mand.

       The format of  here-documents
       is:

              [n]<<[-]word
                      here-document
              delimiter

       No parameter and variable ex‐
       pansion,   command  substitu‐
       tion,  arithmetic  expansion,
       or pathname expansion is per‐
       formed  on word.  If any part
       of word is quoted, the delim‐
       iter is the result  of  quote
       removal   on  word,  and  the
       lines  in  the  here-document
       are not expanded.  If word is
       unquoted,  all  lines  of the
       here-document  are  subjected
       to  parameter expansion, com‐
       mand substitution, and arith‐
       metic expansion, the  charac‐
       ter  sequence  \<newline>  is
       ignored, and \ must  be  used
       to quote the characters \, $,
       and `.

       If  the  redirection operator
       is <<-, then all leading  tab
       characters  are stripped from
       input lines and the line con‐
       taining delimiter.  This  al‐
       lows   here-documents  within
       shell scripts to be  indented
       in a natural fashion.

   Here Strings
       A  variant of here documents,
       the format is:

              [n]<<<word

       The word undergoes tilde  ex‐
       pansion,  parameter and vari‐
       able expansion, command  sub‐
       stitution,  arithmetic expan‐
       sion,  and   quote   removal.
       Pathname  expansion  and word
       splitting are not  performed.
       The  result  is supplied as a
       single string, with a newline
       appended, to the  command  on
       its  standard  input (or file
       descriptor n if n  is  speci‐
       fied).

   Duplicating File Descriptors
       The redirection operator

              [n]<&word

       is  used  to  duplicate input
       file  descriptors.   If  word
       expands  to  one or more dig‐
       its, the file descriptor  de‐
       noted  by  n  is made to be a
       copy of that file descriptor.
       If the digits in word do  not
       specify   a  file  descriptor
       open for input, a redirection
       error occurs.  If word evalu‐
       ates to -, file descriptor  n
       is closed.  If n is not spec‐
       ified,   the  standard  input
       (file descriptor 0) is used.

       The operator

              [n]>&word

       is used similarly  to  dupli‐
       cate output file descriptors.
       If  n  is  not specified, the
       standard  output  (file   de‐
       scriptor  1) is used.  If the
       digits in word do not specify
       a file  descriptor  open  for
       output,  a  redirection error
       occurs.  If word evaluates to
       -,  file  descriptor   n   is
       closed.   As  a special case,
       if n  is  omitted,  and  word
       does  not  expand  to  one or
       more digits or -,  the  stan‐
       dard  output and standard er‐
       ror  are  redirected  as  de‐
       scribed previously.

   Moving File Descriptors
       The redirection operator

              [n]<&digit-

       moves   the  file  descriptor
       digit to file  descriptor  n,
       or  the  standard input (file
       descriptor 0)  if  n  is  not
       specified.   digit  is closed
       after being duplicated to n.

       Similarly,  the   redirection
       operator

              [n]>&digit-

       moves   the  file  descriptor
       digit to file  descriptor  n,
       or  the standard output (file
       descriptor 1)  if  n  is  not
       specified.

   Opening   File   Descriptors  for
       Reading and Writing
       The redirection operator

              [n]<>word

       causes the file whose name is
       the expansion of word  to  be
       opened  for  both reading and
       writing on file descriptor n,
       or on file descriptor 0 if  n
       is  not  specified.   If  the
       file does not  exist,  it  is
       created.

ALIASES
       Aliases  allow a string to be
       substituted for a  word  when
       it  is used as the first word
       of  a  simple  command.   The
       shell  maintains  a  list  of
       aliases that may be  set  and
       unset with the alias and una‐
       lias  builtin  commands  (see
       SHELL  BUILTIN  COMMANDS  be‐
       low).  The first word of each
       simple  command, if unquoted,
       is checked to see if  it  has
       an  alias.   If so, that word
       is replaced by  the  text  of
       the alias.  The characters /,
       $,  `,  and  = and any of the
       shell metacharacters or quot‐
       ing characters  listed  above
       may  not  appear  in an alias
       name.  The  replacement  text
       may  contain  any valid shell
       input,    including     shell
       metacharacters.    The  first
       word of the replacement  text
       is  tested for aliases, but a
       word that is identical to  an
       alias  being  expanded is not
       expanded a second time.  This
       means that one may  alias  ls
       to  ls  -F, for instance, and
       bash does not try  to  recur‐
       sively expand the replacement
       text.   If the last character
       of  the  alias  value  is   a
       blank,  then the next command
       word following the  alias  is
       also checked for alias expan‐
       sion.

       Aliases   are   created   and
       listed with  the  alias  com‐
       mand,  and  removed  with the
       unalias command.

       There is no mechanism for us‐
       ing arguments in the replace‐
       ment text.  If arguments  are
       needed,  use a shell function
       (see FUNCTIONS below).

       Aliases are not expanded when
       the shell is not interactive,
       unless   the   expand_aliases
       shell  option  is  set  using
       shopt (see the description of
       shopt  under  SHELL   BUILTIN
       COMMANDS below).

       The rules concerning the def‐
       inition  and  use  of aliases
       are somewhat confusing.  Bash
       always  reads  at  least  one
       complete  line  of input, and
       all lines that make up a com‐
       pound command, before execut‐
       ing any of  the  commands  on
       that  line  or  the  compound
       command.   Aliases  are   ex‐
       panded   when  a  command  is
       read, not  when  it  is  exe‐
       cuted.   Therefore,  an alias
       definition appearing  on  the
       same  line as another command
       does not  take  effect  until
       the  next  line  of  input is
       read.  The commands following
       the alias definition on  that
       line  are not affected by the
       new alias.  This behavior  is
       also  an issue when functions
       are  executed.   Aliases  are
       expanded when a function def‐
       inition is read, not when the
       function is executed, because
       a  function definition is it‐
       self a command.  As a  conse‐
       quence,  aliases defined in a
       function  are  not  available
       until  after that function is
       executed.  To be safe, always
       put alias  definitions  on  a
       separate line, and do not use
       alias in compound commands.

       For   almost  every  purpose,
       aliases  are  superseded   by
       shell functions.

FUNCTIONS
       A  shell function, defined as
       described above  under  SHELL
       GRAMMAR,  stores  a series of
       commands for later execution.
       When  the  name  of  a  shell
       function  is used as a simple
       command  name,  the  list  of
       commands associated with that
       function  name  is  executed.
       Functions are executed in the
       context of the current shell;
       no new process is created  to
       interpret them (contrast this
       with the execution of a shell
       script).   When a function is
       executed,  the  arguments  to
       the function become the posi‐
       tional  parameters during its
       execution.  The special para‐
       meter # is updated to reflect
       the change.  Special  parame‐
       ter   0  is  unchanged.   The
       first element of the FUNCNAME
       variable is set to  the  name
       of  the  function  while  the
       function is executing.

       All  other  aspects  of   the
       shell  execution  environment
       are identical between a func‐
       tion  and  its  caller   with
       these  exceptions:  the DEBUG
       and RETURN traps (see the de‐
       scription of the trap builtin
       under SHELL BUILTIN  COMMANDS
       below)  are not inherited un‐
       less the  function  has  been
       given   the  trace  attribute
       (see the description  of  the
       declare builtin below) or the
       -o functrace shell option has
       been  enabled  with  the  set
       builtin (in  which  case  all
       functions  inherit  the DEBUG
       and RETURN  traps),  and  the
       ERR trap is not inherited un‐
       less  the  -o  errtrace shell
       option has been enabled.

       Variables local to the  func‐
       tion may be declared with the
       local  builtin command (local
       variables).       Ordinarily,
       variables  and  their  values
       are shared between the  func‐
       tion  and  its  caller.  If a
       variable is  declared  local,
       the  variable's visible scope
       is restricted to  that  func‐
       tion  and  its  children (in‐
       cluding  the   functions   it
       calls).

       In the following description,
       the  current  scope is a cur‐
       rently-  executing  function.
       Previous  scopes  consist  of
       that function's caller and so
       on,  back  to  the   "global"
       scope, where the shell is not
       executing any shell function.
       Consequently,  a  local vari‐
       able at the current scope  is
       a variable declared using the
       local  or declare builtins in
       the  function  that  is  cur‐
       rently executing.

       Local    variables   "shadow"
       variables with the same  name
       declared  at previous scopes.
       For instance, a  local  vari‐
       able  declared  in a function
       hides a  global  variable  of
       the same name: references and
       assignments  refer to the lo‐
       cal  variable,  leaving   the
       global  variable  unmodified.
       When  the  function  returns,
       the  global  variable is once
       again visible.

       The shell uses dynamic  scop‐
       ing  to  control a variable's
       visibility within  functions.
       With dynamic scoping, visible
       variables  and  their  values
       are a result of the  sequence
       of function calls that caused
       execution  to  reach the cur‐
       rent function.  The value  of
       a  variable  that  a function
       sees  depends  on  its  value
       within  its  caller,  if any,
       whether that  caller  is  the
       "global"   scope  or  another
       shell function.  This is also
       the value that a local  vari‐
       able  declaration  "shadows",
       and the  value  that  is  re‐
       stored  when the function re‐
       turns.

       For example,  if  a  variable
       var  is  declared as local in
       function  func1,  and   func1
       calls another function func2,
       references  to  var made from
       within func2 will resolve  to
       the  local  variable var from
       func1, shadowing  any  global
       variable named var.

       The  unset  builtin also acts
       using the same dynamic scope:
       if a variable is local to the
       current scope, unset will un‐
       set it; otherwise  the  unset
       will  refer  to  the variable
       found in any calling scope as
       described above.  If a  vari‐
       able  at  the  current  local
       scope is unset, it  will  re‐
       main  so (appearing as unset)
       until it  is  reset  in  that
       scope  or  until the function
       returns.  Once  the  function
       returns,  any instance of the
       variable at a previous  scope
       will  become visible.  If the
       unset acts on a variable at a
       previous scope, any  instance
       of  a variable with that name
       that had been  shadowed  will
       become visible (see below how
       the  localvar_unset shell op‐
       tion changes this behavior).

       The FUNCNEST variable, if set
       to a  numeric  value  greater
       than  0,  defines  a  maximum
       function    nesting    level.
       Function invocations that ex‐
       ceed  the limit cause the en‐
       tire command to abort.

       If the builtin command return
       is executed  in  a  function,
       the  function  completes  and
       execution  resumes  with  the
       next  command after the func‐
       tion call.  Any command asso‐
       ciated with the  RETURN  trap
       is  executed before execution
       resumes.   When  a   function
       completes,  the values of the
       positional parameters and the
       special parameter #  are  re‐
       stored to the values they had
       prior  to the function's exe‐
       cution.

       Function  names  and  defini‐
       tions  may be listed with the
       -f option to the  declare  or
       typeset   builtin   commands.
       The -F option to  declare  or
       typeset  will  list the func‐
       tion names only (and  option‐
       ally the source file and line
       number, if the extdebug shell
       option  is  enabled).   Func‐
       tions may be exported so that
       child shell processes  (those
       created when executing a sep‐
       arate shell invocation) auto‐
       matically  have  them defined
       with the -f option to the ex‐
       port builtin.  A function de‐
       finition may be deleted using
       the -f option  to  the  unset
       builtin.

       Functions  may  be recursive.
       The FUNCNEST variable may  be
       used  to  limit  the depth of
       the function call  stack  and
       restrict  the number of func‐
       tion  invocations.   By   de‐
       fault, no limit is imposed on
       the   number   of   recursive
       calls.

ARITHMETIC EVALUATION
       The shell  allows  arithmetic
       expressions  to be evaluated,
       under  certain  circumstances
       (see   the  let  and  declare
       builtin commands, the (( com‐
       pound command, and Arithmetic
       Expansion).   Evaluation   is
       done  in fixed-width integers
       with no check  for  overflow,
       though   division   by  0  is
       trapped and flagged as an er‐
       ror.  The operators and their
       precedence,    associativity,
       and values are the same as in
       the  C language.  The follow‐
       ing  list  of  operators   is
       grouped into levels of equal-
       precedence   operators.   The
       levels are listed in order of
       decreasing precedence.

       id++ id--
              variable   post-incre‐
              ment  and  post-decre‐
              ment
       - +    unary minus and plus
       ++id --id
              variable pre-increment
              and pre-decrement
       ! ~    logical  and   bitwise
              negation
       **     exponentiation
       * / %  multiplication,  divi‐
              sion, remainder
       + -    addition, subtraction
       << >>  left and right bitwise
              shifts
       <= >= < >
              comparison
       == !=  equality and  inequal‐
              ity
       &      bitwise AND
       ^      bitwise exclusive OR
       |      bitwise OR
       &&     logical AND
       ||     logical OR
       expr?expr:expr
              conditional operator
       = *= /= %= += -= <<= >>= &=
       ^= |=
              assignment
       expr1 , expr2
              comma

       Shell  variables  are allowed
       as operands; parameter expan‐
       sion is performed before  the
       expression    is   evaluated.
       Within an  expression,  shell
       variables  may also be refer‐
       enced by name  without  using
       the  parameter expansion syn‐
       tax.  A shell  variable  that
       is null or unset evaluates to
       0  when  referenced  by  name
       without using  the  parameter
       expansion  syntax.  The value
       of a variable is evaluated as
       an arithmetic expression when
       it is referenced, or  when  a
       variable which has been given
       the  integer  attribute using
       declare  -i  is  assigned   a
       value.   A  null value evalu‐
       ates to 0.  A shell  variable
       need not have its integer at‐
       tribute  turned on to be used
       in an expression.

       Integer constants follow  the
       C  language definition, with‐
       out  suffixes  or   character
       constants.   Constants with a
       leading 0 are interpreted  as
       octal  numbers.  A leading 0x
       or  0X  denotes  hexadecimal.
       Otherwise,  numbers  take the
       form [base#]n, where the  op‐
       tional base is a decimal num‐
       ber  between  2 and 64 repre‐
       senting the arithmetic  base,
       and  n  is  a  number in that
       base.  If base#  is  omitted,
       then  base  10 is used.  When
       specifying n, if a  non-digit
       is   required,   the   digits
       greater  than  9  are  repre‐
       sented  by the lowercase let‐
       ters, the uppercase  letters,
       @,  and _, in that order.  If
       base is less than or equal to
       36, lowercase  and  uppercase
       letters  may  be  used inter‐
       changeably to represent  num‐
       bers between 10 and 35.

       Operators  are  evaluated  in
       order of precedence.  Sub-ex‐
       pressions in parentheses  are
       evaluated first and may over‐
       ride   the  precedence  rules
       above.

CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS
       Conditional  expressions  are
       used  by the [[ compound com‐
       mand  and  the  test  and   [
       builtin commands to test file
       attributes and perform string
       and  arithmetic  comparisons.
       The test and [  commands  de‐
       termine  their behavior based
       on the number  of  arguments;
       see the descriptions of those
       commands  for  any other com‐
       mand-specific actions.

       Expressions are  formed  from
       the following unary or binary
       primaries.  Bash handles sev‐
       eral filenames specially when
       they are used in expressions.
       If  the  operating  system on
       which bash  is  running  pro‐
       vides  these  special  files,
       bash will use them; otherwise
       it will emulate  them  inter‐
       nally  with this behavior: If
       any file argument to  one  of
       the  primaries is of the form
       /dev/fd/n, then file descrip‐
       tor n  is  checked.   If  the
       file  argument  to one of the
       primaries    is    one     of
       /dev/stdin,  /dev/stdout,  or
       /dev/stderr, file  descriptor
       0,  1, or 2, respectively, is
       checked.

       Unless  otherwise  specified,
       primaries   that  operate  on
       files follow  symbolic  links
       and  operate on the target of
       the  link,  rather  than  the
       link itself.

       When  used with [[, the < and
       > operators sort lexicograph‐
       ically using the current  lo‐
       cale.  The test command sorts
       using ASCII ordering.

              than, or greater  than
              or  equal to arg2, re‐
              spectively.  Arg1  and
              arg2  may  be positive
              or negative  integers.
              When  used with the [[
              command, Arg1 and Arg2
              are    evaluated    as
              arithmetic expressions
              (see ARITHMETIC EVALU‐
              ATION above).

SIMPLE COMMAND EXPANSION
       When a simple command is exe‐
       cuted, the shell performs the
       following expansions, assign‐
       ments, and redirections, from
       left to right, in the follow‐
       ing order.

       1.     The   words  that  the
              parser has  marked  as
              variable   assignments
              (those  preceding  the
              command    name)   and
              redirections are saved
              for later processing.

       2.     The words that are not
              variable   assignments
              or   redirections  are
              expanded.    If    any
              words remain after ex‐
              pansion,   the   first
              word is  taken  to  be
              the  name  of the com‐
              mand and the remaining
              words  are  the  argu‐
              ments.

       3.     Redirections  are per‐
              formed  as   described
              above  under  REDIREC‐
              TION.

       4.     The text after  the  =
              in  each  variable as‐
              signment     undergoes
              tilde expansion, para‐
              meter  expansion, com‐
              mand     substitution,
              arithmetic  expansion,
              and quote removal  be‐
              fore being assigned to
              the variable.

       If  no  command name results,
       the variable assignments  af‐
       fect  the current shell envi‐
       ronment.  In the case of such
       a command (one that  consists
       only of assignment statements
       and redirections), assignment
       statements  are performed be‐
       fore  redirections.    Other‐
       wise, the variables are added
       to the environment of the ex‐
       ecuted command and do not af‐
       fect  the current shell envi‐
       ronment.  If any of  the  as‐
       signments  attempts to assign
       a value to a  readonly  vari‐
       able,  an  error  occurs, and
       the command exits with a non-
       zero status.

       If no command  name  results,
       redirections  are  performed,
       but do not affect the current
       shell environment.   A  redi‐
       rection error causes the com‐
       mand  to exit with a non-zero
       status.

       If there is  a  command  name
       left  after expansion, execu‐
       tion  proceeds  as  described
       below.   Otherwise,  the com‐
       mand exits.  If  one  of  the
       expansions  contained  a com‐
       mand substitution,  the  exit
       status  of the command is the
       exit status of the last  com‐
       mand  substitution performed.
       If there were no command sub‐
       stitutions, the command exits
       with a status of zero.

COMMAND EXECUTION
       After  a  command  has   been
       split  into  words, if it re‐
       sults in a simple command and
       an  optional  list  of  argu‐
       ments,  the following actions
       are taken.

       If the command name  contains
       no  slashes,  the  shell  at‐
       tempts  to  locate  it.    If
       there exists a shell function
       by  that  name, that function
       is invoked as described above
       in FUNCTIONS.   If  the  name
       does  not  match  a function,
       the shell searches for it  in
       the  list  of shell builtins.
       If a  match  is  found,  that
       builtin is invoked.

       If  the  name  is  neither  a
       shell function nor a builtin,
       and contains no slashes, bash
       searches each element of  the
       PATH for a directory contain‐
       ing  an  executable  file  by
       that name.  Bash uses a  hash
       table  to  remember  the full
       pathnames of executable files
       (see hash under SHELL BUILTIN
       COMMANDS  below).    A   full
       search  of the directories in
       PATH is performed only if the
       command is not found  in  the
       hash table.  If the search is
       unsuccessful,    the    shell
       searches for a defined  shell
       function      named      com‐
       mand_not_found_handle.     If
       that  function  exists, it is
       invoked in a separate  execu‐
       tion   environment  with  the
       original  command   and   the
       original  command's arguments
       as  its  arguments,  and  the
       function's  exit  status  be‐
       comes the exit status of that
       subshell.  If  that  function
       is  not  defined,  the  shell
       prints an error  message  and
       returns  an  exit  status  of
       127.

       If the search is  successful,
       or  if  the command name con‐
       tains one  or  more  slashes,
       the  shell executes the named
       program in a separate  execu‐
       tion environment.  Argument 0
       is set to the name given, and
       the  remaining  arguments  to
       the command are  set  to  the
       arguments given, if any.

       If  this  execution fails be‐
       cause the file is not in exe‐
       cutable format, and the  file
       is not a directory, it is as‐
       sumed to be a shell script, a
       file  containing  shell  com‐
       mands, and the shell  creates
       a  new  instance of itself to
       execute  it.   This  subshell
       reinitializes itself, so that
       the  effect  is  as  if a new
       shell  had  been  invoked  to
       handle  the  script, with the
       exception that the  locations
       of commands remembered by the
       parent  (see hash below under
       SHELL BUILTIN  COMMANDS)  are
       retained by the child.

       If  the program is a file be‐
       ginning with #!, the  remain‐
       der  of the first line speci‐
       fies an interpreter  for  the
       program.   The shell executes
       the specified interpreter  on
       operating systems that do not
       handle this executable format
       themselves.  The arguments to
       the  interpreter consist of a
       single optional argument fol‐
       lowing the  interpreter  name
       on the first line of the pro‐
       gram, followed by the name of
       the  program, followed by the
       command arguments, if any.

COMMAND EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT
       The shell  has  an  execution
       environment,  which  consists
       of the following:

       •      open  files  inherited
              by  the shell at invo‐
              cation, as modified by
              redirections  supplied
              to the exec builtin

       •      the   current  working
              directory  as  set  by
              cd, pushd, or popd, or
              inherited by the shell
              at invocation

       •      the file creation mode
              mask  as  set by umask
              or inherited from  the
              shell's parent

       •      current  traps  set by
              trap

       •      shell parameters  that
              are  set  by  variable
              assignment or with set
              or inherited from  the
              shell's  parent in the
              environment

       •      shell  functions   de‐
              fined during execution
              or  inherited from the
              shell's parent in  the
              environment

       •      options enabled at in‐
              vocation   (either  by
              default or  with  com‐
              mand-line   arguments)
              or by set

       •      options   enabled   by
              shopt

       •      shell  aliases defined
              with alias

       •      various  process  IDs,
              including   those   of
              background  jobs,  the
              value  of  $$, and the
              value of PPID

       When a simple  command  other
       than a builtin or shell func‐
       tion is to be executed, it is
       invoked  in a separate execu‐
       tion  environment  that  con‐
       sists  of the following.  Un‐
       less  otherwise  noted,   the
       values are inherited from the
       shell.

       •      the    shell's    open
              files, plus any  modi‐
              fications   and  addi‐
              tions   specified   by
              redirections   to  the
              command

       •      the  current   working
              directory

       •      the file creation mode
              mask

       •      shell   variables  and
              functions  marked  for
              export,   along   with
              variables exported for
              the command, passed in
              the environment

       •      traps  caught  by  the
              shell are reset to the
              values  inherited from
              the  shell's   parent,
              and  traps  ignored by
              the shell are ignored

       A  command  invoked  in  this
       separate  environment  cannot
       affect the shell's  execution
       environment.

       A  subshell  is a copy of the
       shell process.

       Command  substitution,   com‐
       mands  grouped with parenthe‐
       ses,  and  asynchronous  com‐
       mands  are  invoked in a sub‐
       shell environment that  is  a
       duplicate  of the shell envi‐
       ronment,  except  that  traps
       caught by the shell are reset
       to  the values that the shell
       inherited from its parent  at
       invocation.  Builtin commands
       that are invoked as part of a
       pipeline are also executed in
       a    subshell    environment.
       Changes made to the  subshell
       environment cannot affect the
       shell's   execution  environ‐
       ment.

       Subshells spawned to  execute
       command substitutions inherit
       the  value  of  the -e option
       from the parent shell.   When
       not   in   posix  mode,  bash
       clears the -e option in  such
       subshells.

       If a command is followed by a
       &  and job control is not ac‐
       tive,  the  default  standard
       input  for the command is the
       empty file /dev/null.  Other‐
       wise, the invoked command in‐
       herits the  file  descriptors
       of the calling shell as modi‐
       fied by redirections.

ENVIRONMENT
       When  a program is invoked it
       is given an array of  strings
       called the environment.  This
       is   a   list  of  name-value
       pairs,    of     the     form
       name=value.

       The  shell  provides  several
       ways to manipulate the  envi‐
       ronment.   On invocation, the
       shell scans its own  environ‐
       ment  and creates a parameter
       for each name found, automat‐
       ically marking it for  export
       to child processes.  Executed
       commands inherit the environ‐
       ment.  The export and declare
       -x  commands allow parameters
       and functions to be added  to
       and deleted from the environ‐
       ment.   If the value of a pa‐
       rameter in the environment is
       modified, the new  value  be‐
       comes  part  of  the environ‐
       ment, replacing the old.  The
       environment inherited by  any
       executed  command consists of
       the shell's initial  environ‐
       ment,  whose  values  may  be
       modified in the  shell,  less
       any  pairs removed by the un‐
       set command, plus  any  addi‐
       tions  via the export and de‐
       clare -x commands.

       The environment for any  sim‐
       ple  command  or function may
       be augmented  temporarily  by
       prefixing  it  with parameter
       assignments,   as   described
       above  in  PARAMETERS.  These
       assignment statements  affect
       only  the environment seen by
       that command.

       If the -k option is set  (see
       the  set  builtin command be‐
       low), then all parameter  as‐
       signments  are  placed in the
       environment  for  a  command,
       not  just  those that precede
       the command name.

       When bash invokes an external
       command, the  variable  _  is
       set  to  the full filename of
       the  command  and  passed  to
       that  command in its environ‐
       ment.

EXIT STATUS
       The exit status  of  an  exe‐
       cuted  command  is  the value
       returned by the waitpid  sys‐
       tem  call or equivalent func‐
       tion.  Exit statuses fall be‐
       tween 0 and 255,  though,  as
       explained  below,  the  shell
       may use values above 125 spe‐
       cially.  Exit  statuses  from
       shell  builtins  and compound
       commands are also limited  to
       this  range.   Under  certain
       circumstances, the shell will
       use special values  to  indi‐
       cate specific failure modes.

       For  the  shell's purposes, a
       command which  exits  with  a
       zero  exit  status  has  suc‐
       ceeded.  An  exit  status  of
       zero  indicates  success.   A
       non-zero  exit  status  indi‐
       cates  failure.   When a com‐
       mand terminates  on  a  fatal
       signal N, bash uses the value
       of 128+N as the exit status.

       If  a  command  is not found,
       the child process created  to
       execute  it  returns a status
       of  127.   If  a  command  is
       found  but is not executable,
       the return status is 126.

       If a command fails because of
       an error during expansion  or
       redirection,  the exit status
       is greater than zero.

       Shell builtin commands return
       a status of 0 (true) if  suc‐
       cessful, and non-zero (false)
       if an error occurs while they
       execute.  All builtins return
       an  exit status of 2 to indi‐
       cate incorrect usage,  gener‐
       ally invalid options or miss‐
       ing arguments.

       The  exit  status of the last
       command is available  in  the
       special parameter $?.

       Bash  itself returns the exit
       status of  the  last  command
       executed, unless a syntax er‐
       ror  occurs, in which case it
       exits with a non-zero  value.
       See  also  the  exit  builtin
       command below.

SIGNALS
       When bash is interactive,  in
       the  absence of any traps, it
       ignores SIGTERM (so that kill
       0 does not kill  an  interac‐
       tive  shell),  and  SIGINT is
       caught and handled  (so  that
       the  wait  builtin  is inter‐
       ruptible).   In  all   cases,
       bash ignores SIGQUIT.  If job
       control  is  in  effect, bash
       ignores SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU, and
       SIGTSTP.

       Non-builtin commands  run  by
       bash have signal handlers set
       to  the  values  inherited by
       the shell  from  its  parent.
       When  job  control  is not in
       effect, asynchronous commands
       ignore SIGINT and SIGQUIT  in
       addition  to  these inherited
       handlers.  Commands run as  a
       result  of  command substitu‐
       tion ignore the keyboard-gen‐
       erated  job  control  signals
       SIGTTIN,  SIGTTOU,  and SIGT‐
       STP.

       The shell  exits  by  default
       upon  receipt  of  a  SIGHUP.
       Before exiting,  an  interac‐
       tive shell resends the SIGHUP
       to   all   jobs,  running  or
       stopped.   Stopped  jobs  are
       sent  SIGCONT  to ensure that
       they receive the SIGHUP.   To
       prevent  the shell from send‐
       ing the signal to a  particu‐
       lar job, it should be removed
       from  the jobs table with the
       disown  builtin  (see   SHELL
       BUILTIN  COMMANDS  below)  or
       marked to not receive  SIGHUP
       using disown -h.

       If the huponexit shell option
       has been set with shopt, bash
       sends  a  SIGHUP  to all jobs
       when  an  interactive   login
       shell exits.

       If bash is waiting for a com‐
       mand to complete and receives
       a signal for which a trap has
       been  set,  the trap will not
       be executed until the command
       completes.   When   bash   is
       waiting  for  an asynchronous
       command via the wait builtin,
       the reception of a signal for
       which a  trap  has  been  set
       will  cause  the wait builtin
       to return immediately with an
       exit status greater than 128,
       immediately after  which  the
       trap is executed.

       When  job  control is not en‐
       abled, and  bash  is  waiting
       for  a  foreground command to
       complete, the shell  receives
       keyboard-generated    signals
       such as SIGINT (usually  gen‐
       erated by ^C) that users com‐
       monly  intend to send to that
       command.   This  happens  be‐
       cause  the shell and the com‐
       mand are in the same  process
       group as the terminal, and ^C
       sends SIGINT to all processes
       in that process group.

       When  bash is running without
       job control enabled  and  re‐
       ceives  SIGINT  while waiting
       for a foreground command,  it
       waits  until  that foreground
       command terminates  and  then
       decides  what to do about the
       SIGINT:

       1.     If the command  termi‐
              nates  due to the SIG‐
              INT,  bash   concludes
              that the user meant to
              end the entire script,
              and acts on the SIGINT
              (e.g.,  by  running  a
              SIGINT trap or exiting
              itself);

       2.     If  the  command  does
              not  terminate  due to
              SIGINT,  the   program
              handled the SIGINT it‐
              self and did not treat
              it  as a fatal signal.
              In  that  case,   bash
              does  not treat SIGINT
              as a fatal signal, ei‐
              ther, instead assuming
              that  the  SIGINT  was
              used  as  part  of the
              program's normal oper‐
              ation   (e.g.,   emacs
              uses it to abort edit‐
              ing  commands)  or de‐
              liberately  discarded.
              However, bash will run
              any  trap  set on SIG‐
              INT, as it  does  with
              any other trapped sig‐
              nal  it receives while
              it is waiting for  the
              foreground  command to
              complete, for compati‐
              bility.

JOB CONTROL
       Job  control  refers  to  the
       ability  to  selectively stop
       (suspend)  the  execution  of
       processes  and  continue (re‐
       sume) their  execution  at  a
       later  point.   A  user typi‐
       cally employs  this  facility
       via  an interactive interface
       supplied jointly by the oper‐
       ating system kernel's  termi‐
       nal driver and bash.

       The  shell  associates  a job
       with each pipeline.  It keeps
       a table of currently  execut‐
       ing jobs, which may be listed
       with  the jobs command.  When
       bash starts a  job  asynchro‐
       nously  (in  the background),
       it prints a line  that  looks
       like:

              [1] 25647

       indicating  that  this job is
       job number  1  and  that  the
       process   ID   of   the  last
       process in the pipeline asso‐
       ciated  with  this   job   is
       25647.   All of the processes
       in a single pipeline are mem‐
       bers of the same  job.   Bash
       uses  the  job abstraction as
       the basis for job control.

       To facilitate the implementa‐
       tion of the user interface to
       job  control,  the  operating
       system  maintains  the notion
       of a current terminal process
       group ID.   Members  of  this
       process    group   (processes
       whose  process  group  ID  is
       equal to the current terminal
       process   group  ID)  receive
       keyboard-generated    signals
       such    as   SIGINT.    These
       processes are said to  be  in
       the  foreground.   Background
       processes  are  those   whose
       process group ID differs from
       the      terminal's;     such
       processes are immune to  key‐
       board-generated      signals.
       Only foreground processes are
       allowed to read from  or,  if
       the  user  so  specifies with
       stty  tostop,  write  to  the
       terminal.          Background
       processes  which  attempt  to
       read from (write to when stty
       tostop is in effect) the ter‐
       minal   are  sent  a  SIGTTIN
       (SIGTTOU) signal by the  ker‐
       nel's terminal driver, which,
       unless  caught,  suspends the
       process.

       If the  operating  system  on
       which  bash  is  running sup‐
       ports job control, bash  con‐
       tains  facilities  to use it.
       Typing the suspend  character
       (typically   ^Z,   Control-Z)
       while a  process  is  running
       causes  that  process  to  be
       stopped and  returns  control
       to  bash.  Typing the delayed
       suspend character  (typically
       ^Y,   Control-Y)  causes  the
       process to be stopped when it
       attempts to read  input  from
       the  terminal, and control to
       be  returned  to  bash.   The
       user  may then manipulate the
       state of this job, using  the
       bg  command to continue it in
       the background, the  fg  com‐
       mand  to  continue  it in the
       foreground, or the kill  com‐
       mand  to kill it.  A ^Z takes
       effect immediately,  and  has
       the additional side effect of
       causing  pending  output  and
       typeahead to be discarded.

       There are a number of ways to
       refer to a job in the  shell.
       The  character % introduces a
       job specification  (jobspec).
       Job  number n may be referred
       to as %n.  A job may also  be
       referred to using a prefix of
       the name used to start it, or
       using  a  substring  that ap‐
       pears in  its  command  line.
       For  example, %ce refers to a
       stopped  job  whose   command
       name  begins  with  ce.  If a
       prefix matches more than  one
       job,  bash  reports an error.
       Using  %?ce,  on  the   other
       hand,  refers to any job con‐
       taining the string ce in  its
       command  line.   If  the sub‐
       string matches more than  one
       job,  bash  reports an error.
       The symbols %% and  %+  refer
       to  the shell's notion of the
       current  job,  which  is  the
       last job stopped while it was
       in  the foreground or started
       in the background.  The  pre‐
       vious  job  may be referenced
       using %-.  If there is only a
       single job,  %+  and  %-  can
       both be used to refer to that
       job.  In output pertaining to
       jobs (e.g., the output of the
       jobs  command),  the  current
       job is always flagged with  a
       +,  and the previous job with
       a -.  A single % (with no ac‐
       companying job specification)
       also refers  to  the  current
       job.

       Simply  naming  a  job can be
       used to  bring  it  into  the
       foreground:  %1  is a synonym
       for ``fg %1'', bringing job 1
       from the background into  the
       foreground.   Similarly, ``%1
       &''  resumes  job  1  in  the
       background,   equivalent   to
       ``bg %1''.

       The shell learns  immediately
       whenever a job changes state.
       Normally, bash waits until it
       is  about  to  print a prompt
       before reporting changes in a
       job's status so as to not in‐
       terrupt any other output.  If
       the  -b  option  to  the  set
       builtin  command  is enabled,
       bash reports such changes im‐
       mediately.    Any   trap   on
       SIGCHLD  is executed for each
       child that exits.

       If an attempt to exit bash is
       made while jobs  are  stopped
       (or,  if  the checkjobs shell
       option has been enabled using
       the shopt builtin,  running),
       the  shell  prints  a warning
       message, and, if  the  check‐
       jobs option is enabled, lists
       the  jobs and their statuses.
       The jobs command may then  be
       used to inspect their status.
       If  a  second attempt to exit
       is made without an  interven‐
       ing  command,  the shell does
       not  print  another  warning,
       and any stopped jobs are ter‐
       minated.

       When the shell is waiting for
       a  job  or  process using the
       wait builtin, and job control
       is enabled, wait will  return
       when  the  job changes state.
       The -f option causes wait  to
       wait until the job or process
       terminates before returning.

PROMPTING
       When executing interactively,
       bash   displays  the  primary
       prompt PS1 when it  is  ready
       to  read  a  command, and the
       secondary prompt PS2 when  it
       needs  more input to complete
       a command.  Bash displays PS0
       after it reads a command  but
       before  executing  it.   Bash
       displays  PS4  as   described
       above   before  tracing  each
       command when the -x option is
       enabled.  Bash  allows  these
       prompt  strings  to  be  cus‐
       tomized by inserting a number
       of backslash-escaped  special
       characters  that  are decoded
       as follows:
              \a     an  ASCII  bell
                     character (07)
              \d     the   date   in
                     "Weekday  Month
                     Date"    format
                     (e.g., "Tue May
                     26")
              \D{format}
                     the  format  is
                     passed to strf‐
                     time(3) and the
                     result  is  in‐
                     serted into the
                     prompt  string;
                     an empty format
                     results   in  a
                     locale-specific
                     time  represen‐
                     tation.     The
                     braces are  re‐
                     quired
              \e     an ASCII escape
                     character (033)
              \h     the hostname up
                     to   the  first
                     `.'
              \H     the hostname
              \j     the  number  of
                     jobs  currently
                     managed by  the

                     following   the
                     final slash)

                     acters,   which
                     could  be  used
                     to embed a ter‐

                     of non-printing
                     characters

       The  command  number  and the
       history  number  are  usually
       different: the history number
       of  a command is its position
       in the  history  list,  which
       may include commands restored
       from  the  history  file (see
       HISTORY  below),  while   the
       command  number  is the posi‐
       tion in the sequence of  com‐
       mands   executed  during  the
       current shell session.  After
       the string is decoded, it  is
       expanded via parameter expan‐
       sion,  command  substitution,
       arithmetic   expansion,   and
       quote removal, subject to the
       value of the promptvars shell
       option  (see  the description
       of the  shopt  command  under
       SHELL  BUILTIN  COMMANDS  be‐
       low).  This can have unwanted
       side effects if escaped  por‐
       tions  of  the  string appear
       within  command  substitution
       or contain characters special
       to word expansion.

READLINE
       This is the library that han‐
       dles reading input when using
       an  interactive shell, unless
       the  --noediting  option   is
       given  at  shell  invocation.
       Line  editing  is  also  used
       when  using  the -e option to
       the  read  builtin.   By  de‐
       fault,  the line editing com‐
       mands are similar to those of
       Emacs.  A vi-style line edit‐
       ing interface is also  avail‐
       able.   Line  editing  can be
       enabled at any time using the
       -o emacs or -o vi options  to
       the  set  builtin  (see SHELL
       BUILTIN COMMANDS below).   To
       turn  off  line editing after
       the shell is running, use the
       +o emacs or +o vi options  to
       the set builtin.

   Readline Notation
       In  this  section, the Emacs-
       style notation is used to de‐
       note   keystrokes.    Control
       keys  are  denoted  by C-key,
       e.g.,  C-n  means  Control-N.
       Similarly,  meta keys are de‐
       noted by M-key, so M-x  means
       Meta-X.   (On keyboards with‐
       out a meta key, M-x means ESC
       x, i.e., press the Escape key
       then the x key.   This  makes
       ESC  the  meta  prefix.   The
       combination    M-C-x    means
       ESC-Control-x,  or  press the
       Escape key then hold the Con‐
       trol key while pressing the x
       key.)

       Readline  commands   may   be
       given    numeric   arguments,
       which normally act as  a  re‐
       peat  count.  Sometimes, how‐
       ever, it is the sign  of  the
       argument that is significant.
       Passing  a  negative argument
       to a command that acts in the
       forward   direction    (e.g.,
       kill-line)  causes  that com‐
       mand to act in a backward di‐
       rection.  Commands whose  be‐
       havior  with  arguments devi‐
       ates from this are noted  be‐
       low.

       When  a  command is described
       as  killing  text,  the  text
       deleted is saved for possible
       future  retrieval  (yanking).
       The killed text is saved in a
       kill ring.  Consecutive kills
       cause the text to be  accumu‐
       lated  into  one  unit, which
       can be yanked  all  at  once.
       Commands  which  do  not kill
       text separate the  chunks  of
       text on the kill ring.

   Readline Initialization
       Readline   is  customized  by
       putting commands in  an  ini‐
       tialization file (the inputrc
       file).  The name of this file
       is  taken  from  the value of
       the  INPUTRC  variable.    If
       that  variable  is unset, the
       default  is  ~/.inputrc.   If
       that  file  does not exist or
       cannot be read, the  ultimate
       default    is   /etc/inputrc.
       When a program which uses the
       readline library  starts  up,
       the  initialization  file  is
       read, and  the  key  bindings
       and variables are set.  There
       are  only  a  few  basic con‐
       structs allowed in the  read‐
       line   initialization   file.
       Blank  lines   are   ignored.
       Lines  beginning with a # are
       comments.   Lines   beginning
       with a $ indicate conditional
       constructs.   Other lines de‐
       note key bindings  and  vari‐
       able settings.

       The  default key-bindings may
       be changed  with  an  inputrc
       file.   Other  programs  that
       use  this  library  may   add
       their  own commands and bind‐
       ings.

       For example, placing

              M-Control-u:   univer‐
              sal-argument
       or
              C-Meta-u:      univer‐
              sal-argument
       into the inputrc  would  make
       M-C-u  execute  the  readline
       command universal-argument.

       The following symbolic  char‐
       acter  names  are recognized:
       RUBOUT, DEL, ESC,  LFD,  NEW‐
       LINE,   RET,   RETURN,   SPC,
       SPACE, and TAB.

       In addition to command names,
       readline allows  keys  to  be
       bound to a string that is in‐
       serted   when   the   key  is
       pressed (a macro).

   Readline Key Bindings
       The  syntax  for  controlling
       key  bindings  in the inputrc
       file is simple.  All that  is
       required  is  the name of the
       command  or  the  text  of  a
       macro  and  a key sequence to
       which  it  should  be  bound.
       The  name may be specified in
       one of two ways:  as  a  sym‐
       bolic key name, possibly with
       Meta-  or  Control- prefixes,
       or as a key sequence.

       When  using  the  form   key‐
       name:function-name  or macro,
       keyname is the name of a  key
       spelled  out in English.  For
       example:

              Control-u:     univer‐
              sal-argument
              Meta-Rubout: backward-
              kill-word
              Control-o: "> output"

       In  the above example, C-u is
       bound to the function univer‐
       sal-argument, M-DEL is  bound
       to    the    function   back‐
       ward-kill-word,  and  C-o  is
       bound  to  run  the macro ex‐
       pressed  on  the  right  hand
       side  (that is, to insert the
       text ``>  output''  into  the
       line).

       In  the  second  form,  "key‐
       seq":function-name or  macro,
       keyseq  differs  from keyname
       above in that strings  denot‐
       ing  an  entire  key sequence
       may be specified  by  placing
       the  sequence  within  double
       quotes.  Some GNU Emacs style
       key escapes can be  used,  as
       in the following example, but
       the  symbolic character names
       are not recognized.

              "\C-u":  universal-ar‐
              gument
              "\C-x\C-r":
              re-read-init-file
              "\e[11~":    "Function
              Key 1"

       In this example, C-u is again
       bound to the function univer‐
       sal-argument.   C-x  C-r   is
       bound    to    the   function
       re-read-init-file, and ESC  [
       1  1 ~ is bound to insert the
       text ``Function Key 1''.

       The full  set  of  GNU  Emacs
       style escape sequences is
              \C-    control prefix
              \M-    meta prefix
              \e     an escape char‐
                     acter
              \\     backslash
              \"     literal "
              \'     literal '

       In  addition to the GNU Emacs
       style  escape  sequences,   a
       second  set  of backslash es‐
       capes is available:
              \a     alert (bell)
              \b     backspace
              \d     delete
              \f     form feed
              \n     newline
              \r     carriage return
              \t     horizontal tab
              \v     vertical tab
              \nnn   the   eight-bit
                     character whose
                     value   is  the
                     octal value nnn
                     (one  to  three
                     digits)
              \xHH   the   eight-bit
                     character whose
                     value  is   the
                     hexadecimal
                     value  HH  (one
                     or two hex dig‐
                     its)

       When entering the text  of  a
       macro,   single   or   double
       quotes must be used to  indi‐
       cate a macro definition.  Un‐
       quoted  text is assumed to be
       a  function  name.   In   the
       macro body, the backslash es‐
       capes described above are ex‐
       panded.  Backslash will quote
       any  other  character  in the
       macro text, including  "  and
       '.

       Bash allows the current read‐
       line  key bindings to be dis‐
       played or modified  with  the
       bind  builtin  command.   The
       editing mode may be  switched
       during interactive use by us‐
       ing  the -o option to the set
       builtin  command  (see  SHELL
       BUILTIN COMMANDS below).

   Readline Variables
       Readline  has  variables that
       can be used to  further  cus‐
       tomize its behavior.  A vari‐
       able  may be set in the inpu‐
       trc file with a statement  of
       the form

              set      variable-name
              value
       or  using  the  bind  builtin
       command  (see  SHELL  BUILTIN
       COMMANDS below).

       Except where noted,  readline
       variables can take the values
       On  or Off (without regard to
       case).  Unrecognized variable
       names are  ignored.   When  a
       variable value is read, empty
       or  null  values, "on" (case-
       insensitive),  and  "1"   are
       equivalent  to On.  All other
       values are equivalent to Off.
       The variables and  their  de‐
       fault values are:

       active-region-start-color
              A string variable that
              controls    the   text
              color  and  background
              when   displaying  the
              text in the active re‐
              gion (see the descrip‐
              tion   of   enable-ac‐
              tive-region    below).
              This string  must  not
              take  up  any physical
              character positions on
              the  display,  so   it
              should consist only of
              terminal   escape  se‐
              quences.  It is output
              to the terminal before
              displaying the text in
              the   active   region.
              This variable is reset
              to  the  default value
              whenever the  terminal
              type changes.  The de‐
              fault   value  is  the
              string that  puts  the
              terminal  in  standout
              mode, as obtained from
              the  terminal's   ter‐
              minfo  description.  A
              sample value might  be
              "\e[01;33m".
       active-region-end-color
              A string variable that
              "undoes"  the  effects
              of          active-re‐
              gion-start-color   and
              restores "normal" ter‐
              minal display  appear‐
              ance  after displaying
              text in the active re‐
              gion.    This   string
              must  not  take up any
              physical character po‐
              sitions  on  the  dis‐
              play,   so  it  should
              consist only of termi‐
              nal escape  sequences.
              It  is  output  to the
              terminal  after   dis‐
              playing  the  text  in
              the   active   region.
              This variable is reset
              to  the  default value
              whenever the  terminal
              type changes.  The de‐
              fault   value  is  the
              string  that  restores
              the    terminal   from
              standout mode, as  ob‐
              tained from the termi‐
              nal's   terminfo   de‐
              scription.   A  sample
              value     might     be
              "\e[0m".
       bell-style (audible)
              Controls what  happens
              when readline wants to
              ring    the   terminal
              bell.  If set to none,
              readline  never  rings
              the  bell.   If set to
              visible, readline uses
              a visible bell if  one
              is  available.  If set
              to  audible,  readline
              attempts  to  ring the
              terminal's bell.
       bind-tty-special-chars (On)
              If set to On, readline
              attempts to  bind  the
              control     characters
              treated  specially  by
              the  kernel's terminal
              driver to their  read‐
              line equivalents.
       blink-matching-paren (Off)
              If set to On, readline
              attempts   to  briefly
              move the cursor to  an
              opening    parenthesis
              when a closing  paren‐
              thesis is inserted.
       colored-completion-prefix
       (Off)
              If  set  to  On,  when
              listing   completions,
              readline  displays the
              common prefix  of  the
              set  of  possible com‐
              pletions using a  dif‐
              ferent   color.    The
              color definitions  are
              taken  from  the value
              of the LS_COLORS envi‐
              ronment variable.   If
              there is a color defi‐
              nition  in  $LS_COLORS
              for the custom  suffix
              "readline-colored-com‐
              pletion-prefix", read‐
              line  uses  this color
              for the common  prefix
              instead   of  its  de‐
              fault.
       colored-stats (Off)
              If set to On, readline
              displays possible com‐
              pletions using differ‐
              ent colors to indicate
              their file type.   The
              color  definitions are
              taken from  the  value
              of the LS_COLORS envi‐
              ronment variable.
       comment-begin (``#'')
              The string that is in‐
              serted  when the read‐
              line    insert-comment
              command  is  executed.
              This command is  bound
              to  M-#  in emacs mode
              and to # in vi command
              mode.
       completion-display-width (-1)
              The number  of  screen
              columns  used  to dis‐
              play possible  matches
              when  performing  com‐
              pletion.  The value is
              ignored if it is  less
              than 0 or greater than
              the   terminal  screen
              width.  A value  of  0
              will  cause matches to
              be displayed  one  per
              line.    The   default
              value is -1.
       completion-ignore-case (Off)
              If set to On, readline
              performs      filename
              matching  and  comple‐
              tion in a  case-insen‐
              sitive fashion.
       completion-map-case (Off)
              If set to On, and com‐
              pletion-ignore-case is
              enabled,      readline
              treats hyphens (-) and
              underscores   (_)   as
              equivalent  when  per‐
              forming  case-insensi‐
              tive filename matching
              and completion.
       completion-prefix-dis‐
       play-length (0)
              The  length in charac‐
              ters  of  the   common
              prefix  of  a  list of
              possible   completions
              that    is   displayed
              without  modification.
              When  set  to  a value
              greater   than   zero,
              common prefixes longer
              than  this  value  are
              replaced with  an  el‐
              lipsis when displaying
              possible completions.
       completion-query-items (100)
              This  determines  when
              the  user  is  queried
              about viewing the num‐
              ber  of  possible com‐
              pletions generated  by
              the   possible-comple‐
              tions command.  It may
              be set to any  integer
              value  greater than or
              equal to zero.  If the
              number   of   possible
              completions is greater
              than  or  equal to the
              value  of  this  vari‐
              able,   readline  will
              ask whether or not the
              user  wishes  to  view
              them;  otherwise  they
              are simply  listed  on
              the  terminal.  A zero
              value  means  readline
              should never ask; neg‐
              ative    values    are
              treated as zero.
       convert-meta (On)
              If set to On, readline
              will  convert  charac‐
              ters  with  the eighth
              bit set  to  an  ASCII
              key sequence by strip‐
              ping  the  eighth  bit
              and prefixing  an  es‐
              cape character (in ef‐
              fect,  using escape as
              the meta prefix).  The
              default  is  On,   but
              readline  will  set it
              to Off if  the  locale
              contains     eight-bit
              characters.       This
              variable  is dependent
              on the LC_CTYPE locale
              category,   and    may
              change  if  the locale
              is changed.
       disable-completion (Off)
              If set to On, readline
              will inhibit word com‐
              pletion.    Completion
              characters will be in‐
              serted  into  the line
              as if  they  had  been
              mapped to self-insert.
       echo-control-characters (On)
              When set to On, on op‐
              erating  systems  that
              indicate they  support
              it,  readline echoes a
              character  correspond‐
              ing to a signal gener‐
              ated   from  the  key‐
              board.
       editing-mode (emacs)
              Controls whether read‐
              line begins with a set
              of key bindings  simi‐
              lar  to  Emacs  or vi.
              editing-mode  can   be
              set to either emacs or
              vi.
       emacs-mode-string (@)
              If                 the
              show-mode-in-prompt
              variable  is  enabled,
              this  string  is  dis‐
              played immediately be‐
              fore the last line  of
              the   primary   prompt
              when   emacs   editing
              mode  is  active.  The
              value is expanded like
              a key binding, so  the
              standard  set of meta-
              and  control  prefixes
              and  backslash  escape
              sequences  is   avail‐
              able.   Use the \1 and
              \2  escapes  to  begin
              and  end  sequences of
              non-printing   charac‐
              ters,   which  can  be
              used to embed a termi‐
              nal  control  sequence
              into the mode string.
       enable-active-region (On)
              The  point is the cur‐
              rent cursor  position,
              and  mark  refers to a
              saved cursor position.
              The text  between  the
              point  and mark is re‐
              ferred to as  the  re‐
              gion.  When this vari‐
              able  is  set  to  On,
              readline  allows  cer‐
              tain  commands to des‐
              ignate the  region  as
              active.   When the re‐
              gion is active,  read‐
              line   highlights  the
              text in the region us‐
              ing the value  of  the
              active-re‐
              gion-start-color,
              which  defaults to the
              string  that   enables
              the  terminal's stand‐
              out mode.  The  active
              region  shows the text
              inserted by bracketed-
              paste and any matching
              text found  by  incre‐
              mental  and non-incre‐
              mental         history
              searches.
       enable-bracketed-paste (On)
              When  set to On, read‐
              line  configures   the
              terminal   to   insert
              each  paste  into  the
              editing  buffer  as  a
              single string of char‐
              acters,   instead   of
              treating  each charac‐
              ter as if it had  been
              read   from  the  key‐
              board.  This  prevents
              readline  from execut‐
              ing any  editing  com‐
              mands bound to key se‐
              quences  appearing  in
              the pasted text.
       enable-keypad (Off)
              When set to On,  read‐
              line  will  try to en‐
              able  the  application
              keypad   when   it  is
              called.  Some  systems
              need  this  to  enable
              the arrow keys.
       enable-meta-key (On)
              When set to On,  read‐
              line  will  try to en‐
              able any meta modifier
              key    the    terminal
              claims to support when
              it is called.  On many
              terminals,   the  meta
              key is  used  to  send
              eight-bit characters.
       expand-tilde (Off)
              If  set  to  On, tilde
              expansion is performed
              when readline attempts
              word completion.
       history-preserve-point (Off)
              If set to On, the his‐
              tory code attempts  to
              place   point  at  the
              same location on  each
              history line retrieved
              with  previous-history
              or next-history.
       history-size (unset)
              Set the maximum number
              of   history   entries
              saved  in  the history
              list.  If set to zero,
              any  existing  history
              entries   are  deleted
              and no new entries are
              saved.  If  set  to  a
              value  less than zero,
              the number of  history
              entries  is  not  lim‐
              ited.  By default, the
              number of history  en‐
              tries  is  set  to the
              value of the  HISTSIZE
              shell variable.  If an
              attempt is made to set
              history-size to a non-
              numeric   value,   the
              maximum number of his‐
              tory entries  will  be
              set to 500.
       horizontal-scroll-mode (Off)
              When  set to On, makes
              readline use a  single
              line    for   display,
              scrolling  the   input
              horizontally on a sin‐
              gle  screen  line when
              it becomes longer than
              the    screen    width
              rather  than  wrapping
              to a new  line.   This
              setting  is  automati‐
              cally enabled for ter‐
              minals of height 1.
       input-meta (Off)
              If set to On, readline
              will enable  eight-bit
              input   (that  is,  it
              will  not  strip   the
              eighth  bit  from  the
              characters it  reads),
              regardless of what the
              terminal claims it can
              support.    The   name
              meta-flag is a synonym
              for   this   variable.
              The  default  is  Off,
              but readline will  set
              it to On if the locale
              contains     eight-bit
              characters.       This
              variable  is dependent
              on the LC_CTYPE locale
              category,   and    may
              change  if  the locale
              is changed.
       isearch-terminators
       (``C-[C-J'')
              The string of  charac‐
              ters  that should ter‐
              minate an  incremental
              search  without subse‐
              quently executing  the
              character  as  a  com‐
              mand.  If  this  vari‐
              able   has   not  been
              given  a  value,   the
              characters ESC and C-J
              will  terminate an in‐
              cremental search.
       keymap (emacs)
              Set the current  read‐
              line  keymap.  The set
              of valid keymap  names
              is  emacs, emacs-stan‐
              dard,      emacs-meta,
              emacs-ctlx,        vi,
              vi-command, and vi-in‐
              sert.  vi  is  equiva‐
              lent   to  vi-command;
              emacs is equivalent to
              emacs-standard.    The
              default    value    is
              emacs;  the  value  of
              editing-mode  also af‐
              fects   the    default
              keymap.
       keyseq-timeout (500)
              Specifies the duration
              readline will wait for
              a character when read‐
              ing  an  ambiguous key
              sequence (one that can
              form  a  complete  key
              sequence using the in‐
              put  read  so  far, or
              can  take   additional
              input  to  complete  a
              longer key  sequence).
              If  no  input  is  re‐
              ceived   within    the
              timeout, readline will
              use  the  shorter  but
              complete key sequence.
              The value is specified
              in milliseconds, so  a
              value  of  1000  means
              that   readline   will
              wait  one  second  for
              additional input.   If
              this  variable  is set
              to a value  less  than
              or  equal  to zero, or
              to    a    non-numeric
              value,  readline  will
              wait until another key
              is pressed  to  decide
              which  key sequence to
              complete.
       mark-directories (On)
              If  set  to  On,  com‐
              pleted directory names
              have a slash appended.
       mark-modified-lines (Off)
              If  set to On, history
              lines that  have  been
              modified are displayed
              with  a  preceding as‐
              terisk (*).
       mark-symlinked-directories
       (Off)
              If  set  to  On,  com‐
              pleted names which are
              symbolic  links to di‐
              rectories have a slash
              appended  (subject  to
              the  value of mark-di‐
              rectories).
       match-hidden-files (On)
              This  variable,   when
              set   to   On,  causes
              readline   to    match
              files  whose names be‐
              gin with a `.' (hidden
              files) when performing
              filename   completion.
              If  set  to  Off,  the
              leading  `.'  must  be
              supplied  by  the user
              in the filename to  be
              completed.
       menu-complete-display-prefix
       (Off)
              If  set  to  On,  menu
              completion    displays
              the  common  prefix of
              the list  of  possible
              completions (which may
              be  empty)  before cy‐
              cling   through    the
              list.
       output-meta (Off)
              If set to On, readline
              will  display  charac‐
              ters with  the  eighth
              bit    set    directly
              rather than as a meta-
              prefixed  escape   se‐
              quence.   The  default
              is Off,  but  readline
              will  set  it to On if
              the  locale   contains
              eight-bit  characters.
              This variable  is  de‐
              pendent     on     the
              LC_CTYPE locale  cate‐
              gory,  and  may change
              if   the   locale   is
              changed.
       page-completions (On)
              If set to On, readline
              uses an internal more-
              like  pager to display
              a screenful of  possi‐
              ble  completions  at a
              time.
       print-completions-horizon‐
       tally (Off)
              If set to On, readline
              will  display  comple‐
              tions   with   matches
              sorted horizontally in
              alphabetical    order,
              rather  than  down the
              screen.
       revert-all-at-newline (Off)
              If set to On, readline
              will undo all  changes
              to  history  lines be‐
              fore  returning   when
              accept-line   is  exe‐
              cuted.   By   default,
              history  lines  may be
              modified  and   retain
              individual  undo lists
              across calls to  read‐
              line.
       show-all-if-ambiguous (Off)
              This  alters  the  de‐
              fault behavior of  the
              completion  functions.
              If set  to  On,  words
              which  have  more than
              one  possible  comple‐
              tion cause the matches
              to  be  listed immedi‐
              ately instead of ring‐
              ing the bell.
       show-all-if-unmodified (Off)
              This  alters  the  de‐
              fault  behavior of the
              completion   functions
              in  a  fashion similar
              to show-all-if-ambigu‐
              ous.  If  set  to  On,
              words  which have more
              than one possible com‐
              pletion  without   any
              possible  partial com‐
              pletion (the  possible
              completions      don't
              share a common prefix)
              cause the  matches  to
              be  listed immediately
              instead of ringing the
              bell.
       show-mode-in-prompt (Off)
              If set to  On,  add  a
              string  to  the begin‐
              ning of the prompt in‐
              dicating  the  editing
              mode:  emacs,  vi com‐
              mand, or vi insertion.
              The mode  strings  are
              user-settable   (e.g.,
              emacs-mode-string).
       skip-completed-text (Off)
              If set to On, this al‐
              ters the default  com‐
              pletion  behavior when
              inserting   a   single
              match  into  the line.
              It's only active  when
              performing  completion
              in  the  middle  of  a
              word.    If   enabled,
              readline does not  in‐
              sert  characters  from
              the  completion   that
              match characters after
              point  in the word be‐
              ing completed, so por‐
              tions of the word fol‐
              lowing the cursor  are
              not duplicated.
       vi-cmd-mode-string ((cmd))
              If                 the

              sequences    of   non-
              printing   characters,
              which  can  be used to
              embed a terminal  con‐
              trol sequence into the
              mode string.
       vi-ins-mode-string ((ins))
              If                 the
              show-mode-in-prompt
              variable  is  enabled,
              this  string  is  dis‐

              and  backslash  escape
              sequences   is  avail‐

              and end  sequences  of
              non-printing   charac‐

              used to embed a termi‐
              nal  control  sequence
              into the mode string.

   Readline Conditional Constructs
       Readline  implements a facil‐
       ity similar in spirit to  the
       conditional  compilation fea‐
       tures of the  C  preprocessor
       which allows key bindings and
       variable  settings to be per‐
       formed  as  the   result   of
       tests.  There are four parser
       directives used.

       $if    The  $if construct al‐
              lows  bindings  to  be
              made   based   on  the
              editing mode, the ter‐
              minal being  used,  or
              the  application using
              readline.  The text of
              the  test,  after  any
              comparison operator,
               extends to the end of
              the  line; unless oth‐
              erwise noted, no char‐
              acters are required to
              isolate it.

              mode   The mode=  form
                     of  the $if di‐
                     rective is used
                     to test whether
                     readline is  in
                     emacs   or   vi
                     mode.  This may
                     be used in con‐
                     junction   with
                     the  set keymap
                     command,    for
                     instance,    to
                     set bindings in
                     the emacs-stan‐
                     dard        and
                     emacs-ctlx
                     keymaps only if
                     readline     is
                     starting out in
                     emacs mode.

              term   The term=  form
                     may  be used to
                     include  termi‐
                     nal-specific
                     key   bindings,
                     perhaps to bind
                     the   key   se‐
                     quences  output
                     by  the  termi‐
                     nal's  function
                     keys.  The word
                     on  the   right
                     side  of  the =
                     is       tested
                     against    both
                     the  full  name
                     of the terminal
                     and the portion
                     of the terminal
                     name before the
                     first  -.  This
                     allows  sun  to
                     match  both sun
                     and    sun-cmd,
                     for instance.

              version
                     The     version
                     test   may   be
                     used to perform
                     comparisons
                     against    spe‐
                     cific  readline
                     versions.   The
                     version expands
                     to the  current
                     readline   ver‐
                     sion.  The  set
                     of   comparison
                     operators   in‐
                     cludes  =, (and
                     ==),  !=,   <=,
                     >=,  <,  and >.
                     The     version
                     number supplied
                     on   the  right
                     side of the op‐
                     erator consists
                     of a major ver‐
                     sion number, an
                     optional  deci‐
                     mal  point, and
                     an optional mi‐
                     nor     version
                     (e.g., 7.1). If
                     the  minor ver‐
                     sion  is  omit‐
                     ted,  it is as‐
                     sumed to be  0.
                     The    operator
                     may  be   sepa‐
                     rated  from the
                     string  version
                     and   from  the
                     version  number
                     argument     by
                     whitespace.

              application
                     The application
                     construct    is
                     used to include
                     application-
                     specific   set‐
                     tings.     Each
                     program   using
                     the    readline
                     library    sets
                     the application
                     name,  and   an
                     initialization
                     file  can  test
                     for a  particu‐
                     lar      value.
                     This  could  be
                     used   to  bind
                     key   sequences
                     to    functions
                     useful  for   a
                     specific   pro‐
                     gram.  For  in‐
                     stance,     the
                     following  com‐
                     mand adds a key
                     sequence   that
                     quotes the cur‐
                     rent or  previ‐
                     ous   word   in
                     bash:

                     $if Bash
                     # Quote the current or previous word
                     "\C-xq": "\eb\"\ef\""
                     $endif

              variable
                     The    variable
                     construct  pro‐
                     vides    simple
                     equality  tests
                     for    readline
                     variables   and
                     values.     The
                     permitted  com‐

                     tors are =, ==,

                     side by  white‐

                     string      and
                     boolean   vari‐
                     ables  may   be
                     tested. Boolean
                     variables  must
                     be       tested
                     against     the
                     values  on  and
                     off.

       $endif This  command, as seen
              in the previous  exam‐
              ple, terminates an $if
              command.

       $else  Commands    in    this
              branch of the $if  di‐
              rective  are  executed
              if the test fails.

       $include
              This directive takes a
              single filename as  an
              argument   and   reads
              commands and  bindings
              from  that  file.  For
              example, the following
              directive  would  read
              /etc/inputrc:

              $include  /etc/inputrc

   Searching
       Readline   provides  commands
       for  searching  through   the
       command  history (see HISTORY
       below) for lines containing a
       specified string.  There  are
       two search modes: incremental
       and non-incremental.

       Incremental   searches  begin
       before the user has  finished
       typing the search string.  As
       each  character of the search
       string  is  typed,   readline
       displays  the next entry from
       the  history   matching   the
       string  typed so far.  An in‐
       cremental   search   requires
       only  as  many  characters as
       needed to  find  the  desired
       history  entry.   The charac‐
       ters present in the value  of
       the isearch-terminators vari‐
       able are used to terminate an
       incremental  search.  If that
       variable  has  not  been  as‐
       signed a value the Escape and
       Control-J   characters   will
       terminate   an    incremental
       search.  Control-G will abort
       an incremental search and re‐
       store   the   original  line.
       When  the  search  is  termi‐
       nated, the history entry con‐
       taining the search string be‐
       comes the current line.

       To  find  other  matching en‐
       tries in  the  history  list,
       type  Control-S  or Control-R
       as  appropriate.   This  will
       search backward or forward in
       the  history for the next en‐
       try   matching   the   search
       string  typed  so  far.   Any
       other key sequence bound to a
       readline command will  termi‐
       nate  the  search and execute
       that command.  For  instance,
       a  newline will terminate the
       search and accept  the  line,
       thereby executing the command
       from the history list.

       Readline  remembers  the last
       incremental  search   string.
       If  two  Control-Rs are typed
       without any intervening char‐
       acters defining a new  search
       string, any remembered search
       string is used.

       Non-incremental searches read
       the  entire search string be‐
       fore starting to  search  for
       matching  history lines.  The
       search string may be typed by
       the user or be  part  of  the
       contents of the current line.

   Readline Command Names
       The  following  is  a list of
       the names of the commands and
       the default key sequences  to
       which  they  are bound.  Com‐
       mand names without an  accom‐
       panying  key sequence are un‐
       bound  by  default.   In  the
       following descriptions, point
       refers  to the current cursor
       position, and mark refers  to
       a  cursor  position  saved by
       the  set-mark  command.   The
       text  between  the  point and
       mark is referred  to  as  the
       region.

   Commands for Moving
       beginning-of-line (C-a)
              Move  to  the start of
              the current line.
       end-of-line (C-e)
              Move to the end of the
              line.
       forward-char (C-f)
              Move forward a charac‐
              ter.
       backward-char (C-b)
              Move back a character.
       forward-word (M-f)
              Move  forward  to  the
              end  of the next word.
              Words are composed  of
              alphanumeric   charac‐
              ters (letters and dig‐
              its).
       backward-word (M-b)
              Move back to the start
              of the current or pre‐
              vious word.  Words are
              composed  of  alphanu‐
              meric characters (let‐
              ters and digits).
       shell-forward-word
              Move  forward  to  the
              end of the next  word.
              Words are delimited by
              non-quoted       shell
              metacharacters.
       shell-backward-word
              Move back to the start
              of the current or pre‐
              vious word.  Words are
              delimited   by    non-
              quoted shell metachar‐
              acters.
       previous-screen-line
              Attempt  to move point
              to the  same  physical
              screen  column  on the
              previous      physical
              screen line. This will
              not  have  the desired
              effect if the  current
              readline line does not
              take  up more than one
              physical  line  or  if
              point  is  not greater
              than the length of the
              prompt plus the screen
              width.
       next-screen-line
              Attempt to move  point
              to  the  same physical
              screen column  on  the
              next  physical  screen
              line.  This  will  not
              have  the  desired ef‐
              fect  if  the  current
              readline line does not
              take  up more than one
              physical  line  or  if
              the length of the cur‐
              rent  readline line is
              not greater  than  the
              length  of  the prompt
              plus the screen width.
       clear-display (M-C-l)
              Clear the screen  and,
              if  possible, the ter‐
              minal's     scrollback
              buffer,   then  redraw
              the   current    line,
              leaving   the  current
              line at the top of the
              screen.
       clear-screen (C-l)
              Clear the screen, then
              redraw   the   current
              line, leaving the cur‐
              rent  line  at the top
              of the  screen.   With
              an  argument,  refresh
              the current line with‐
              out    clearing    the
              screen.
       redraw-current-line
              Refresh   the  current
              line.

   Commands  for  Manipulating   the
       History
       accept-line (Newline, Return)
              Accept  the  line  re‐
              gardless of where  the
              cursor  is.   If  this
              line is non-empty, add
              it to the history list
              according to the state
              of   the   HISTCONTROL
              variable.  If the line
              is  a modified history
              line, then restore the
              history  line  to  its
              original state.
       previous-history (C-p)
              Fetch   the   previous

              tory list, moving back
              in the list.
       next-history (C-n)
              Fetch the next command
              from the history list,

              list.
       beginning-of-history (M-<)
              Move to the first line
              in the history.
       end-of-history (M->)
              Move to the end of the
              input  history,  i.e.,
              the line currently be‐
              ing entered.
       operate-and-get-next (C-o)
              Accept   the   current
              line for execution and
              fetch  the  next  line
              relative  to  the cur‐
              rent  line  from   the
              history  for  editing.
              A numeric argument, if
              supplied,    specifies
              the  history  entry to
              use  instead  of   the
              current line.
       fetch-history
              With  a  numeric argu‐
              ment, fetch that entry
              from the history  list
              and  make  it the cur‐
              rent line.  Without an
              argument, move back to
              the first entry in the
              history list.
       reverse-search-history (C-r)
              Search backward start‐
              ing  at  the   current
              line  and  moving `up'
              through the history as
              necessary.  This is an
              incremental search.
       forward-search-history (C-s)
              Search forward  start‐
              ing   at  the  current
              line and moving `down'
              through the history as
              necessary.  This is an
              incremental search.
       non-incremental-re‐
       verse-search-history (M-p)
              Search        backward
              through   the  history
              starting at  the  cur‐
              rent line using a non-
              incremental search for
              a  string  supplied by
              the user.
       non-incremental-for‐
       ward-search-history (M-n)
              Search forward through
              the  history  using  a
              non-incremental search
              for  a string supplied
              by the user.
       history-search-forward
              Search forward through
              the  history  for  the
              string  of  characters
              between the  start  of
              the  current  line and
              the point.  This is  a
              non-incremental
              search.
       history-search-backward
              Search        backward
              through  the   history
              for   the   string  of
              characters between the
              start of  the  current
              line  and  the  point.
              This is  a  non-incre‐
              mental search.
       history-sub‐
       string-search-backward
              Search        backward
              through  the   history
              for   the   string  of
              characters between the
              start of  the  current
              line  and  the current
              cursor  position  (the
              point).    The  search
              string may match  any‐
              where   in  a  history
              line.  This is a  non-
              incremental search.
       history-substring-search-for‐
       ward
              Search forward through
              the  history  for  the
              string  of  characters
              between  the  start of
              the current  line  and
              the point.  The search
              string  may match any‐
              where  in  a   history
              line.   This is a non-
              incremental search.
       yank-nth-arg (M-C-y)
              Insert the first argu‐
              ment to  the  previous
              command  (usually  the
              second  word  on   the
              previous    line)   at
              point.  With an  argu‐
              ment n, insert the nth
              word from the previous
              command  (the words in
              the  previous  command
              begin with word 0).  A
              negative  argument in‐
              serts  the  nth   word
              from  the  end  of the
              previous      command.
              Once the argument n is
              computed, the argument
              is extracted as if the
              "!n" history expansion
              had been specified.
       yank-last-arg (M-., M-_)
              Insert  the last argu‐
              ment to  the  previous
              command (the last word
              of  the  previous his‐
              tory entry).   With  a
              numeric  argument, be‐
              have   exactly    like
              yank-nth-arg.  Succes‐
              sive      calls     to
              yank-last-arg     move
              back  through the his‐
              tory  list,  inserting
              the  last word (or the
              word specified by  the
              argument  to the first
              call) of each line  in
              turn.  Any numeric ar‐
              gument   supplied   to
              these successive calls
              determines the  direc‐
              tion  to  move through
              the history.  A  nega‐
              tive argument switches
              the  direction through
              the history  (back  or
              forward).  The history
              expansion   facilities
              are  used  to  extract
              the  last  word, as if
              the "!$"  history  ex‐
              pansion had been spec‐
              ified.
       shell-expand-line (M-C-e)
              Expand the line as the
              shell does.  This per‐
              forms  alias  and his‐
              tory expansion as well
              as all  of  the  shell
              word  expansions.  See
              HISTORY EXPANSION  be‐
              low  for a description
              of history expansion.
       history-expand-line (M-^)
              Perform history expan‐
              sion  on  the  current
              line.  See HISTORY EX‐
              PANSION  below  for  a
              description of history
              expansion.
       magic-space
              Perform history expan‐
              sion  on  the  current
              line   and   insert  a
              space.   See   HISTORY
              EXPANSION  below for a
              description of history
              expansion.
       alias-expand-line
              Perform  alias  expan‐
              sion  on  the  current
              line.    See   ALIASES
              above  for  a descrip‐
              tion of  alias  expan‐
              sion.
       history-and-alias-expand-line
              Perform   history  and
              alias expansion on the
              current line.
       insert-last-argument (M-.,
       M-_)
              A     synonym      for
              yank-last-arg.
       edit-and-execute-command (C-x
       C-e)
              Invoke  an  editor  on
              the  current   command
              line,  and execute the
              result as  shell  com‐
              mands.   Bash attempts
              to   invoke   $VISUAL,
              $EDITOR,  and emacs as
              the  editor,  in  that
              order.

   Commands for Changing Text
       end-of-file (usually C-d)
              The character indicat‐
              ing   end-of-file   as
              set, for  example,  by
              ``stty''.    If   this
              character is read when
              there are  no  charac‐
              ters  on the line, and
              point is at the begin‐
              ning  of   the   line,
              readline interprets it
              as  the  end  of input
              and returns EOF.
       delete-char (C-d)
              Delete  the  character
              at   point.   If  this
              function is  bound  to
              the  same character as
              the tty EOF character,
              as  C-d  commonly  is,
              see  above for the ef‐
              fects.
       backward-delete-char (Rubout)
              Delete  the  character
              behind   the   cursor.
              When given  a  numeric
              argument,   save   the
              deleted  text  on  the
              kill ring.
       forward-backward-delete-char
              Delete  the  character
              under the cursor,  un‐
              less  the cursor is at
              the end of  the  line,
              in   which   case  the
              character  behind  the
              cursor is deleted.
       quoted-insert (C-q, C-v)
              Add the next character
              typed to the line ver‐
              batim.  This is how to
              insert characters like
              C-q, for example.
       tab-insert (C-v TAB)
              Insert  a  tab charac‐
              ter.
       self-insert
       (a, b, A, 1, !, ...)
              Insert  the  character
              typed.
       transpose-chars (C-t)
              Drag the character be‐
              fore   point   forward
              over the character  at
              point,   moving  point
              forward as  well.   If
              point is at the end of
              the  line,  then  this
              transposes   the   two
              characters      before
              point.  Negative argu‐
              ments have no effect.
       transpose-words (M-t)
              Drag the  word  before
              point  past  the  word
              after  point,   moving
              point  over  that word
              as well.  If point  is
              at   the  end  of  the
              line, this  transposes
              the  last two words on
              the line.
       upcase-word (M-u)
              Uppercase the  current
              (or  following)  word.
              With a negative  argu‐
              ment,   uppercase  the
              previous word, but  do
              not move point.
       downcase-word (M-l)
              Lowercase  the current
              (or  following)  word.
              With  a negative argu‐
              ment,  lowercase   the
              previous  word, but do
              not move point.
       capitalize-word (M-c)
              Capitalize the current
              (or  following)  word.
              With  a negative argu‐
              ment,  capitalize  the
              previous  word, but do
              not move point.
       overwrite-mode
              Toggle overwrite mode.
              With an explicit posi‐
              tive numeric argument,
              switches to  overwrite
              mode.    With  an  ex‐
              plicit    non-positive
              numeric      argument,
              switches   to   insert
              mode.    This  command
              affects   only   emacs
              mode;   vi  mode  does
              overwrite differently.
              Each  call  to   read‐
              line()  starts  in in‐
              sert mode.   In  over‐
              write mode, characters
              bound  to  self-insert
              replace  the  text  at
              point    rather   than
              pushing  the  text  to
              the right.  Characters
              bound     to     back‐
              ward-delete-char   re‐
              place   the  character
              before  point  with  a
              space.    By  default,
              this  command  is  un‐
              bound.

   Killing and Yanking
       kill-line (C-k)

              Kill   backward   from
              point to the beginning
              of   the   line.   The
              killed text  is  saved
              on the kill-ring.
       kill-whole-line
              Kill all characters on
              the  current  line, no

       kill-word (M-d)
              Kill from point to the
              end  of  the   current
              word,  or  if  between
              words, to the  end  of
              the  next  word.  Word
              boundaries   are   the
              same  as those used by
              forward-word.
       backward-kill-word (M-Rubout)
              Kill the  word  behind
              point.    Word  bound‐
              aries are the same  as
              those  used  by  back‐
              ward-word.
       shell-kill-word
              Kill from point to the
              end  of  the   current
              word,  or  if  between
              words, to the  end  of
              the  next  word.  Word
              boundaries   are   the
              same  as those used by
              shell-forward-word.
       shell-backward-kill-word
              Kill the  word  behind
              point.    Word  bound‐

              those      used     by
              shell-backward-word.
       unix-word-rubout (C-w)
              Kill the  word  behind
              point,   using   white
              space as a word bound‐
              ary.  The killed  text
              is  saved on the kill-
              ring.
       unix-filename-rubout
              Kill the  word  behind
              point,   using   white
              space  and  the  slash
              character  as the word
              boundaries.        The
              killed  text  is saved
              on the kill-ring.
       delete-horizontal-space (M-\)
              Delete all spaces  and
              tabs around point.
       kill-region

              current region.
       copy-region-as-kill
              Copy the text  in  the
              region   to  the  kill
              buffer.
       copy-backward-word
              Copy the  word  before
              point   to   the  kill
              buffer.    The    word
              boundaries   are   the
              same as backward-word.
       copy-forward-word
              Copy the word  follow‐
              ing  point to the kill
              buffer.    The    word
              boundaries   are   the
              same as forward-word.
       yank (C-y)
              Yank the  top  of  the
              kill   ring  into  the
              buffer at point.
       yank-pop (M-y)
              Rotate the kill  ring,
              and  yank the new top.
              Only  works  following
              yank or yank-pop.

   Numeric Arguments
       digit-argument (M-0, M-1,
       ..., M--)
              Add  this digit to the
              argument already accu‐
              mulating, or  start  a
              new   argument.    M--
              starts a negative  ar‐
              gument.
       universal-argument
              This is another way to
              specify  an  argument.
              If  this  command   is
              followed   by  one  or
              more  digits,  option‐
              ally  with  a  leading
              minus sign, those dig‐
              its define  the  argu‐
              ment.   If the command
              is followed by digits,
              executing      univer‐
              sal-argument     again
              ends the numeric argu‐
              ment, but is otherwise
              ignored.  As a special
              case, if this  command
              is   immediately  fol‐
              lowed by  a  character
              that   is   neither  a
              digit nor minus  sign,
              the argument count for
              the  next  command  is
              multiplied  by   four.
              The  argument count is
              initially one, so exe‐
              cuting  this  function
              the  first  time makes
              the   argument   count
              four,  a  second  time
              makes   the   argument
              count  sixteen, and so
              on.

   Completing
       complete (TAB)
              Attempt   to   perform
              completion on the text
              before   point.   Bash
              attempts    completion
              treating the text as a
              variable  (if the text
              begins with $),  user‐
              name  (if the text be‐
              gins with ~), hostname
              (if  the  text  begins
              with  @),  or  command
              (including aliases and
              functions)  in   turn.
              If  none of these pro‐
              duces a  match,  file‐
              name completion is at‐
              tempted.
       possible-completions (M-?)
              List the possible com‐
              pletions  of  the text
              before point.
       insert-completions (M-*)
              Insert all completions
              of  the  text   before
              point  that would have
              been generated by pos‐
              sible-completions.
       menu-complete
              Similar  to  complete,
              but  replaces the word
              to be completed with a
              single match from  the
              list  of possible com‐
              pletions.     Repeated
              execution of menu-com‐
              plete   steps  through
              the list  of  possible
              completions, inserting
              each  match  in  turn.
              At the end of the list
              of  completions,   the
              bell  is rung (subject
              to  the   setting   of
              bell-style)   and  the
              original text  is  re‐
              stored.   An  argument
              of n moves n positions
              forward in the list of
              matches;  a   negative
              argument  may  be used
              to    move    backward
              through    the   list.
              This  command  is  in‐
              tended  to be bound to
              TAB, but is unbound by
              default.
       menu-complete-backward
              Identical to menu-com‐
              plete, but moves back‐
              ward through the  list
              of   possible  comple‐
              tions, as if menu-com‐
              plete had been given a
              negative     argument.
              This  command  is  un‐
              bound by default.
       delete-char-or-list
              Deletes the  character
              under  the  cursor  if
              not at  the  beginning
              or  end  of  the  line
              (like    delete-char).
              If  at  the end of the
              line, behaves  identi‐
              cally to possible-com‐
              pletions.   This  com‐
              mand is unbound by de‐
              fault.
       complete-filename (M-/)
              Attempt filename  com‐
              pletion  on  the  text
              before point.
       possible-filename-completions
       (C-x /)
              List the possible com‐
              pletions of  the  text
              before point, treating
              it as a filename.
       complete-username (M-~)
              Attempt  completion on
              the text before point,
              treating it as a user‐
              name.
       possible-username-completions
       (C-x ~)
              List the possible com‐
              pletions of  the  text
              before point, treating
              it as a username.
       complete-variable (M-$)
              Attempt  completion on
              the text before point,
              treating it as a shell
              variable.
       possible-variable-completions
       (C-x $)
              List the possible com‐
              pletions of  the  text
              before point, treating
              it  as  a  shell vari‐
              able.
       complete-hostname (M-@)
              Attempt completion  on
              the text before point,

              name.
       possible-hostname-completions
       (C-x @)
              List the possible com‐
              pletions  of  the text
              before point, treating
              it as a hostname.
       complete-command (M-!)
              Attempt completion  on
              the text before point,
              treating  it as a com‐
              mand  name.    Command
              completion attempts to
              match the text against
              aliases,      reserved
              words,   shell   func‐
              tions, shell builtins,
              and finally executable
              filenames, in that or‐
              der.
       possible-command-completions
       (C-x !)
              List the possible com‐
              pletions  of  the text
              before point, treating
              it as a command name.
       dynamic-complete-history
       (M-TAB)
              Attempt completion  on
              the text before point,
              comparing   the   text
              against lines from the
              history list for  pos‐
              sible       completion
              matches.
       dabbrev-expand
              Attempt  menu  comple‐
              tion  on  the text be‐
              fore point,  comparing
              the text against lines
              from  the history list
              for  possible  comple‐
              tion matches.
       complete-into-braces (M-{)
              Perform  filename com‐
              pletion and insert the
              list of possible  com‐
              pletions      enclosed
              within braces  so  the
              list  is  available to
              the shell  (see  Brace
              Expansion above).

              Read  in  the contents
              of the  inputrc  file,
              and   incorporate  any
              bindings  or  variable
              assignments      found
              there.
       abort (C-g)
              Abort   the    current
              editing   command  and
              ring  the   terminal's
              bell  (subject  to the
              setting             of
              bell-style).
       do-lowercase-version (M-A,
       M-B, M-x, ...)
              If  the metafied char‐
              acter x is  uppercase,
              run  the  command that
              is bound to the corre‐
              sponding metafied low‐
              ercase character.  The

              Undo all changes  made
              to this line.  This is
              like   executing   the
              undo  command   enough
              times  to  return  the

              mark.
       character-search (C-])
              A  character  is  read
              and  point is moved to
              the next occurrence of
              that   character.    A
              negative      argument
              searches for  previous
              occurrences.
       character-search-backward
       (M-C-])
              A  character  is  read
              and point is moved  to
              the   previous  occur‐
              rence of that  charac‐
              ter.  A negative argu‐
              ment searches for sub‐
              sequent occurrences.
       skip-csi-sequence
              Read enough characters
              to consume a multi-key
              sequence such as those
              defined  for keys like
              Home  and  End.   Such
              sequences begin with a
              Control Sequence Indi‐
              cator  (CSI),  usually
              ESC-[.   If  this  se‐
              quence   is  bound  to
              "\[",  keys  producing
              such   sequences  will
              have no effect  unless
              explicitly  bound to a
              readline command,  in‐
              stead   of   inserting
              stray characters  into
              the   editing  buffer.
              This is unbound by de‐
              fault,   but   usually
              bound to ESC-[.
       insert-comment (M-#)
              Without  a numeric ar‐
              gument, the  value  of
              the    readline   com‐
              ment-begin variable is
              inserted at the begin‐
              ning  of  the  current
              line.   If  a  numeric
              argument is  supplied,
              this command acts as a
              toggle: if the charac‐
              ters  at the beginning
              of  the  line  do  not
              match   the  value  of
              comment-begin,     the
              value   is   inserted,
              otherwise the  charac‐
              ters  in comment-begin
              are deleted  from  the
              beginning of the line.
              In  either  case,  the
              line is accepted as if
              a  newline  had   been
              typed.    The  default
              value of comment-begin
              causes this command to
              make the current  line
              a shell comment.  If a
              numeric       argument
              causes   the   comment
              character  to  be  re‐
              moved, the  line  will
              be   executed  by  the
              shell.
       spell-correct-word (C-x s)
              Perform spelling  cor‐
              rection on the current
              word, treating it as a
              directory or filename,
              in the same way as the
              cdspell  shell option.
              Word  boundaries   are
              the same as those used
              by shell-forward-word.
       glob-complete-word (M-g)
              The  word before point
              is treated as  a  pat‐
              tern  for pathname ex‐
              pansion, with  an  as‐
              terisk  implicitly ap‐
              pended.  This  pattern
              is  used to generate a
              list of matching file‐
              names   for   possible
              completions.
       glob-expand-word (C-x *)
              The  word before point
              is treated as  a  pat‐
              tern  for pathname ex‐
              pansion, and the  list
              of  matching filenames
              is inserted, replacing
              the word.   If  a  nu‐
              meric argument is sup‐
              plied,  an asterisk is
              appended before  path‐
              name expansion.
       glob-list-expansions (C-x g)
              The list of expansions
              that  would  have been
              generated by  glob-ex‐
              pand-word    is   dis‐
              played, and  the  line
              is  redrawn.  If a nu‐
              meric argument is sup‐
              plied, an asterisk  is
              appended  before path‐
              name expansion.
       dump-functions
              Print all of the func‐
              tions  and  their  key
              bindings  to the read‐
              line  output   stream.
              If  a numeric argument
              is supplied, the  out‐
              put  is  formatted  in
              such a way that it can
              be made part of an in‐
              putrc file.
       dump-variables
              Print all of the  set‐
              table  readline  vari‐
              ables and their values
              to the readline output
              stream.  If a  numeric
              argument  is supplied,
              the output is  format‐
              ted in such a way that
              it can be made part of
              an inputrc file.
       dump-macros
              Print all of the read‐
              line   key   sequences
              bound  to  macros  and
              the  strings they out‐
              put.  If a numeric ar‐
              gument  is   supplied,
              the  output is format‐
              ted in such a way that
              it can be made part of
              an inputrc file.
       display-shell-version (C-x
       C-v)
              Display version infor‐
              mation about the  cur‐
              rent instance of bash.

   Programmable Completion
       When  word  completion is at‐
       tempted for an argument to  a
       command  for  which a comple‐
       tion specification  (a  comp‐
       spec)  has been defined using
       the  complete  builtin   (see
       SHELL  BUILTIN  COMMANDS  be‐
       low), the  programmable  com‐
       pletion  facilities  are  in‐
       voked.

       First, the  command  name  is
       identified.   If  the command
       word  is  the  empty   string
       (completion  attempted at the
       beginning of an empty  line),
       any compspec defined with the
       -E   option  to  complete  is
       used.  If a compspec has been
       defined for that command, the
       compspec is used to  generate
       the  list of possible comple‐
       tions for the word.   If  the
       command  word is a full path‐
       name, a compspec for the full
       pathname  is   searched   for
       first.   If  no  compspec  is
       found for the full  pathname,
       an  attempt is made to find a
       compspec for the portion fol‐
       lowing the final  slash.   If
       those  searches do not result
       in a compspec,  any  compspec
       defined with the -D option to
       complete  is  used as the de‐
       fault.  If there  is  no  de‐
       fault compspec, bash attempts
       alias  expansion  on the com‐
       mand word as a final  resort,
       and  attempts to find a comp‐
       spec  for  the  command  word
       from  any  successful  expan‐
       sion.

       Once  a  compspec  has   been
       found, it is used to generate
       the  list  of matching words.
       If a compspec is  not  found,
       the  default  bash completion
       as described above under Com‐
       pleting is performed.

       First, the actions  specified
       by  the  compspec  are  used.
       Only matches which  are  pre‐
       fixed  by the word being com‐
       pleted  are  returned.   When
       the  -f  or -d option is used
       for  filename  or   directory
       name  completion,  the  shell
       variable FIGNORE is  used  to
       filter the matches.

       Any  completions specified by
       a pathname expansion  pattern
       to  the  -G option are gener‐
       ated next.  The words  gener‐
       ated  by the pattern need not
       match  the  word  being  com‐
       pleted.  The GLOBIGNORE shell
       variable  is not used to fil‐
       ter the matches, but the FIG‐
       NORE variable is used.

       Next, the string specified as
       the argument to the -W option
       is considered.  The string is
       first split using the charac‐
       ters in the IFS special vari‐
       able  as  delimiters.   Shell
       quoting   is  honored.   Each
       word is then  expanded  using
       brace expansion, tilde expan‐
       sion,  parameter and variable
       expansion, command  substitu‐
       tion,  and  arithmetic expan‐
       sion, as described above  un‐
       der  EXPANSION.   The results
       are split using the rules de‐
       scribed  above   under   Word
       Splitting.   The  results  of
       the  expansion  are   prefix-
       matched  against the word be‐
       ing completed, and the match‐
       ing words become the possible
       completions.

       After these matches have been
       generated, any shell function
       or command specified with the
       -F and -C options is invoked.
       When the command or  function
       is  invoked,  the  COMP_LINE,
       COMP_POINT,   COMP_KEY,   and
       COMP_TYPE  variables  are as‐
       signed  values  as  described
       above  under Shell Variables.
       If a shell function is  being
       invoked,  the  COMP_WORDS and
       COMP_CWORD variables are also
       set.  When  the  function  or
       command is invoked, the first
       argument  ($1) is the name of
       the command  whose  arguments
       are being completed, the sec‐
       ond argument ($2) is the word
       being   completed,   and  the
       third argument  ($3)  is  the
       word preceding the word being
       completed on the current com‐
       mand  line.   No filtering of
       the   generated   completions
       against  the  word being com‐
       pleted  is   performed;   the
       function  or command has com‐
       plete freedom  in  generating
       the matches.

       Any  function  specified with
       -F  is  invoked  first.   The
       function  may  use any of the
       shell  facilities,  including
       the compgen builtin described
       below,    to   generate   the
       matches.   It  must  put  the
       possible  completions  in the
       COMPREPLY array variable, one
       per array element.

       Next, any  command  specified
       with the -C option is invoked
       in  an environment equivalent
       to command substitution.   It
       should  print  a list of com‐
       pletions, one  per  line,  to
       the  standard  output.  Back‐
       slash may be used to escape a
       newline, if necessary.

       After  all  of  the  possible
       completions   are  generated,
       any filter specified with the
       -X option is applied  to  the
       list.   The  filter is a pat‐
       tern as used for pathname ex‐
       pansion; a & in  the  pattern
       is  replaced with the text of
       the word being completed.   A
       literal & may be escaped with
       a backslash; the backslash is
       removed  before  attempting a
       match.  Any  completion  that
       matches  the  pattern will be
       removed  from  the  list.   A
       leading  !  negates  the pat‐
       tern; in this case  any  com‐
       pletion not matching the pat‐
       tern will be removed.  If the
       nocasematch  shell  option is
       enabled, the  match  is  per‐
       formed  without regard to the
       case  of  alphabetic  charac‐
       ters.

       Finally,  any prefix and suf‐
       fix specified with the -P and
       -S options are added to  each
       member   of   the  completion
       list, and the result  is  re‐
       turned  to  the readline com‐
       pletion code as the  list  of
       possible completions.

       If the previously-applied ac‐
       tions  do  not  generate  any
       matches, and the -o  dirnames
       option  was  supplied to com‐
       plete when the  compspec  was
       defined,  directory name com‐
       pletion is attempted.

       If the -o plusdirs option was
       supplied to complete when the
       compspec was defined,  direc‐
       tory  name  completion is at‐
       tempted and any  matches  are
       added  to  the results of the
       other actions.

       By default, if a compspec  is
       found,  whatever it generates
       is returned to the completion
       code as the full set of  pos‐
       sible  completions.   The de‐
       fault  bash  completions  are
       not  attempted, and the read‐
       line default of filename com‐
       pletion is disabled.  If  the
       -o   bashdefault  option  was
       supplied to complete when the
       compspec  was  defined,   the
       bash  default completions are
       attempted  if  the   compspec
       generates no matches.  If the
       -o  default  option  was sup‐
       plied to  complete  when  the
       compspec  was  defined, read‐
       line's   default   completion
       will   be  performed  if  the
       compspec (and, if  attempted,
       the default bash completions)
       generate no matches.

       When   a  compspec  indicates
       that directory  name  comple‐
       tion is desired, the program‐
       mable   completion  functions
       force readline  to  append  a
       slash   to   completed  names
       which are symbolic  links  to
       directories,  subject  to the
       value of the mark-directories
       readline variable, regardless
       of the setting of  the  mark-
       symlinked-directories   read‐
       line variable.

       There is some support for dy‐
       namically  modifying  comple‐
       tions.   This  is most useful
       when used in combination with
       a default  completion  speci‐
       fied  with complete -D.  It's
       possible for shell  functions
       executed  as  completion han‐
       dlers to indicate  that  com‐
       pletion  should be retried by
       returning an exit  status  of
       124.  If a shell function re‐
       turns  124,  and  changes the
       compspec associated with  the
       command  on  which completion
       is being attempted  (supplied
       as  the  first  argument when
       the  function  is  executed),
       programmable       completion
       restarts from the  beginning,
       with an attempt to find a new
       compspec  for  that  command.
       This allows a set of  comple‐
       tions to be built dynamically
       as  completion  is attempted,
       rather than being loaded  all
       at once.

       For  instance,  assuming that
       there is a library  of  comp‐
       specs,  each  kept  in a file
       corresponding to the name  of
       the  command,  the  following
       default  completion  function
       would load completions dynam‐
       ically:

       _completion_loader()
       {
            .     "/etc/bash_comple‐
       tion.d/$1.sh" >/dev/null 2>&1
       && return 124
       }
       complete   -D   -F   _comple‐
       tion_loader -o bashdefault -o
       default

HISTORY
       When the -o history option to
       the  set  builtin is enabled,
       the shell provides access  to
       the command history, the list
       of commands previously typed.
       The  value  of  the  HISTSIZE
       variable is used as the  num‐
       ber  of commands to save in a
       history list.   The  text  of
       the  last  HISTSIZE  commands
       (default 500) is saved.   The
       shell  stores each command in
       the history list prior to pa‐
       rameter and  variable  expan‐
       sion  (see  EXPANSION  above)
       but after  history  expansion
       is  performed, subject to the
       values of the shell variables
       HISTIGNORE and HISTCONTROL.

       On startup,  the  history  is
       initialized   from  the  file
       named by the  variable  HIST‐
       FILE   (default  ~/.bash_his‐
       tory).  The file named by the
       value of  HISTFILE  is  trun‐
       cated,  if necessary, to con‐
       tain no more than the  number
       of  lines  specified  by  the
       value  of  HISTFILESIZE.   If
       HISTFILESIZE is unset, or set
       to null, a non-numeric value,
       or  a numeric value less than
       zero, the history file is not
       truncated.  When the  history
       file is read, lines beginning
       with   the   history  comment
       character  followed   immedi‐
       ately  by  a digit are inter‐
       preted as timestamps for  the
       following    history    line.
       These timestamps are  option‐
       ally  displayed  depending on
       the value of the HISTTIMEFOR‐
       MAT variable.  When  a  shell
       with  history  enabled exits,
       the last $HISTSIZE lines  are
       copied  from the history list
       to $HISTFILE.  If the histap‐
       pend shell option is  enabled
       (see the description of shopt
       under  SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
       below),  the  lines  are  ap‐
       pended  to  the history file,
       otherwise the history file is
       overwritten.  If HISTFILE  is
       unset, or if the history file
       is unwritable, the history is
       not  saved.  If the HISTTIME‐
       FORMAT variable is set,  time
       stamps  are  written  to  the
       history file, marked with the
       history comment character, so
       they may be preserved  across
       shell  sessions.   This  uses
       the history comment character
       to   distinguish   timestamps
       from   other  history  lines.
       After saving the history, the
       history file is truncated  to
       contain  no  more  than HIST‐
       FILESIZE lines.  If HISTFILE‐
       SIZE  is  unset,  or  set  to
       null, a non-numeric value, or
       a  numeric  value  less  than
       zero, the history file is not
       truncated.

       The builtin command  fc  (see
       SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below)
       may  be  used to list or edit
       and re-execute a  portion  of
       the  history  list.  The his‐
       tory builtin may be  used  to
       display or modify the history
       list  and manipulate the his‐
       tory file.  When  using  com‐
       mand-line   editing,   search
       commands  are  available   in
       each  editing  mode that pro‐
       vide access  to  the  history
       list.

       The shell allows control over
       which  commands  are saved on
       the history list.  The  HIST‐
       CONTROL  and HISTIGNORE vari‐
       ables may be set to cause the
       shell to save only  a  subset
       of the commands entered.  The
       cmdhist  shell option, if en‐
       abled, causes  the  shell  to
       attempt  to save each line of
       a multi-line command  in  the
       same  history  entry,  adding
       semicolons where necessary to
       preserve  syntactic  correct‐
       ness.   The lithist shell op‐
       tion causes the shell to save
       the  command  with   embedded
       newlines   instead  of  semi‐
       colons.  See the  description
       of  the  shopt  builtin below
       under SHELL BUILTIN  COMMANDS
       for  information  on  setting
       and unsetting shell options.

HISTORY EXPANSION
       The shell supports a  history
       expansion   feature  that  is
       similar to the history expan‐
       sion in  csh.   This  section
       describes  what  syntax  fea‐
       tures  are  available.   This
       feature is enabled by default
       for  interactive  shells, and
       can be disabled using the  +H
       option  to  the  set  builtin
       command  (see  SHELL  BUILTIN
       COMMANDS  below).  Non-inter‐
       active shells do not  perform
       history expansion by default.

       History  expansions introduce
       words from the  history  list
       into the input stream, making
       it  easy  to repeat commands,
       insert  the  arguments  to  a
       previous   command  into  the
       current input  line,  or  fix
       errors  in  previous commands
       quickly.

       History  expansion  is   per‐
       formed  immediately  after  a
       complete line is read, before
       the  shell  breaks  it   into
       words,  and  is  performed on
       each line individually  with‐
       out  taking quoting on previ‐
       ous lines into  account.   It
       takes  place  in  two  parts.
       The  first  is  to  determine
       which  line  from the history
       list to use during  substitu‐
       tion.   The  second is to se‐
       lect portions  of  that  line
       for  inclusion  into the cur‐
       rent one.  The line  selected
       from   the   history  is  the
       event, and  the  portions  of
       that line that are acted upon
       are words.  Various modifiers
       are  available  to manipulate
       the selected words.  The line
       is broken into words  in  the
       same  fashion as when reading
       input,   so   that    several
       metacharacter-separated words
       surrounded by quotes are con‐
       sidered  one  word.   History
       expansions are introduced  by
       the appearance of the history
       expansion character, which is
       ! by default.  Only backslash
       (\)  and  single  quotes  can
       quote the  history  expansion
       character,  but  the  history
       expansion character  is  also
       treated as quoted if it imme‐
       diately  precedes the closing
       double  quote  in  a  double-
       quoted string.

       Several   characters  inhibit
       history  expansion  if  found
       immediately   following   the
       history expansion  character,
       even   if   it  is  unquoted:
       space, tab, newline, carriage
       return, and =.  If  the  ext‐
       glob shell option is enabled,
       (  will  also  inhibit expan‐
       sion.

       Several  shell  options  set‐
       table  with the shopt builtin
       may be used to tailor the be‐
       havior of history  expansion.
       If  the  histverify shell op‐
       tion is enabled (see the  de‐
       scription    of   the   shopt
       builtin below), and  readline
       is  being  used, history sub‐
       stitutions  are  not  immedi‐
       ately  passed  to  the  shell
       parser.   Instead,  the   ex‐
       panded  line is reloaded into
       the readline  editing  buffer
       for further modification.  If
       readline  is  being used, and
       the histreedit  shell  option
       is  enabled, a failed history
       substitution will be reloaded
       into  the  readline   editing
       buffer  for  correction.  The
       -p  option  to  the   history
       builtin  command  may be used
       to see what a history  expan‐
       sion will do before using it.
       The  -s option to the history
       builtin may be  used  to  add
       commands  to  the  end of the
       history list without actually
       executing them, so that  they
       are  available for subsequent
       recall.

       The shell allows  control  of
       the  various  characters used
       by  the   history   expansion
       mechanism  (see  the descrip‐
       tion of histchars above under
       Shell Variables).  The  shell
       uses   the   history  comment
       character  to  mark   history
       timestamps  when  writing the
       history file.

   Event Designators
       An event designator is a ref‐
       erence to a command line  en‐
       try in the history list.  Un‐
       less  the  reference  is  ab‐
       solute, events  are  relative
       to  the  current  position in
       the history list.

       !      Start a  history  sub‐
              stitution, except when
              followed  by  a blank,
              newline, carriage  re‐
              turn, = or ( (when the
              extglob  shell  option
              is enabled  using  the
              shopt builtin).
       !n     Refer  to command line
              n.
       !-n    Refer to  the  current
              command minus n.
       !!     Refer  to the previous
              command.   This  is  a
              synonym for `!-1'.
       !string
              Refer  to the most re‐
              cent command preceding
              the  current  position
              in  the  history  list
              starting with string.
       !?string[?]
              Refer to the most  re‐
              cent command preceding
              the  current  position
              in  the  history  list
              containing     string.
              The trailing ? may  be
              omitted  if  string is
              followed   immediately
              by   a   newline.   If
              string is missing, the
              string from  the  most
              recent search is used;
              it   is  an  error  if
              there is  no  previous
              search string.
       ^string1^string2^
              Quick    substitution.
              Repeat  the   previous
              command,     replacing
              string1 with  string2.
              Equivalent          to
              ``!!:s^string1^string2^''
              (see Modifiers below).
       !#     The   entire   command
              line typed so far.

   Word Designators
       Word  designators are used to
       select desired words from the
       event.   A  :  separates  the
       event  specification from the
       word designator.  It  may  be
       omitted  if the word designa‐
       tor begins with a ^, $, *, -,
       or  %.   Words  are  numbered
       from  the  beginning  of  the
       line, with the first word be‐
       ing  denoted  by  0   (zero).
       Words  are  inserted into the
       current  line  separated   by
       single spaces.

       0 (zero)
              The  zeroth word.  For
              the shell, this is the
              command word.
       n      The nth word.
       ^      The  first   argument.
              That is, word 1.
       $      The  last  word.  This
              is  usually  the  last
              argument, but will ex‐
              pand   to  the  zeroth
              word if there is  only
              one word in the line.
       %      The first word matched
              by   the  most  recent
              `?string?' search,  if
              the  search string be‐
              gins with a  character
              that   is  part  of  a
              word.
       x-y    A range of words; `-y'
              abbreviates `0-y'.
       *      All of the  words  but
              the zeroth.  This is a
              synonym for `1-$'.  It
              is not an error to use
              * if there is just one
              word in the event; the
              empty  string  is  re‐
              turned in that case.
       x*     Abbreviates x-$.
       x-     Abbreviates  x-$  like
              x*, but omits the last
              word.   If  x is miss‐
              ing, it defaults to 0.

       If a word designator is  sup‐
       plied without an event speci‐
       fication,  the  previous com‐
       mand is used as the event.

   Modifiers
       After the optional word  des‐
       ignator,  there  may appear a
       sequence of one  or  more  of
       the following modifiers, each
       preceded  by  a  `:'.   These
       modify, or edit, the word  or
       words  selected from the his‐
       tory event.

       h      Remove   a    trailing
              filename    component,
              leaving only the head.
       t      Remove   all   leading
              filename   components,
              leaving the tail.
       r      Remove a trailing suf‐
              fix of the form  .xxx,
              leaving the basename.
       e      Remove   all  but  the
              trailing suffix.
       p      Print the new  command
              but do not execute it.
       q      Quote  the substituted
              words,  escaping  fur‐
              ther substitutions.
       x      Quote  the substituted
              words as with  q,  but
              break  into  words  at
              blanks  and  newlines.
              The  q and x modifiers
              are  mutually   exclu‐
              sive;   the  last  one
              supplied is used.
       s/old/new/
              Substitute new for the
              first  occurrence   of
              old in the event line.
              Any  character  may be
              used as the  delimiter
              in  place  of  /.  The
              final delimiter is op‐
              tional if  it  is  the
              last  character of the
              event line.   The  de‐
              limiter  may be quoted
              in old and new with  a
              single  backslash.  If
              & appears in  new,  it
              is replaced by old.  A
              single  backslash will
              quote the &.   If  old
              is  null, it is set to
              the last  old  substi‐
              tuted,  or, if no pre‐
              vious history  substi‐
              tutions   took  place,
              the last string  in  a
              !?string[?]    search.
              If new is  null,  each
              matching     old    is
              deleted.
       &      Repeat  the   previous
              substitution.
       g      Cause  changes  to  be
              applied over  the  en‐
              tire event line.  This
              is used in conjunction
              with    `:s'    (e.g.,
              `:gs/old/new/')     or
              `:&'.   If  used  with
              `:s',  any   delimiter
              can  be  used in place
              of /,  and  the  final
              delimiter  is optional
              if  it  is  the   last
              character of the event
              line.   An  a  may  be
              used as a synonym  for
              g.
       G      Apply   the  following
              `s'  or  `&'  modifier
              once  to  each word in
              the event line.

SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
       Unless otherwise noted,  each
       builtin command documented in
       this section as accepting op‐
       tions  preceded  by - accepts
       -- to signify the end of  the
       options.  The :, true, false,
       and  test/[  builtins  do not
       accept  options  and  do  not
       treat   --   specially.   The
       exit, logout, return,  break,
       continue,   let,   and  shift
       builtins accept  and  process
       arguments  beginning  with  -
       without requiring --.   Other
       builtins  that  accept  argu‐
       ments but are  not  specified
       as  accepting  options inter‐
       pret arguments beginning with
       - as invalid options and  re‐
       quire  -- to prevent this in‐
       terpretation.
       : [arguments]
              No effect; the command
              does  nothing   beyond
              expanding    arguments
              and   performing   any
              specified     redirec‐
              tions.    The   return
              status is zero.

        .  filename [arguments]
       source filename [arguments]
              Read  and execute com‐
              mands from filename in
              the current shell  en‐
              vironment  and  return
              the exit status of the
              last command  executed
              from   filename.    If
              filename does not con‐
              tain  a  slash,  file‐
              names in PATH are used
              to  find the directory
              containing   filename,
              but  filename does not
              need to be executable.
              The file searched  for
              in  PATH  need  not be
              executable.  When bash
              is not in posix  mode,
              it  searches  the cur‐
              rent directory  if  no
              file is found in PATH.
              If  the sourcepath op‐
              tion  to   the   shopt
              builtin   command   is
              turned off,  the  PATH
              is  not  searched.  If
              any arguments are sup‐
              plied, they become the
              positional  parameters
              when  filename is exe‐
              cuted.  Otherwise  the
              positional  parameters
              are unchanged.  If the
              -T option is  enabled,
              . inherits any trap on
              DEBUG;  if  it is not,
              any DEBUG trap  string
              is  saved and restored
              around the call to  .,
              and . unsets the DEBUG
              trap   while  it  exe‐
              cutes.  If -T  is  not
              set,  and  the sourced
              file changes the DEBUG
              trap, the new value is
              retained when  .  com‐
              pletes.    The  return
              status is  the  status
              of  the  last  command
              exited   within    the
              script  (0  if no com‐
              mands  are  executed),
              and  false if filename
              is not found or cannot
              be read.

       alias [-p] [name[=value] ...]
              Alias  with  no  argu‐
              ments  or  with the -p
              option prints the list
              of aliases in the form
              alias  name=value   on
              standard output.  When
              arguments   are   sup‐
              plied, an alias is de‐
              fined  for  each  name
              whose  value is given.
              A  trailing  space  in
              value  causes the next
              word to be checked for
              alias     substitution
              when  the alias is ex‐
              panded.  For each name
              in the  argument  list
              for  which no value is
              supplied, the name and
              value of the alias  is
              printed.    Alias  re‐
              turns  true  unless  a
              name   is   given  for
              which  no  alias   has
              been defined.

       bg [jobspec ...]
              Resume  each suspended
              job  jobspec  in   the
              background,  as  if it
              had been started  with
              &.   If jobspec is not
              present,  the  shell's
              notion  of the current
              job is used.  bg  job‐
              spec  returns 0 unless
              run when  job  control
              is  disabled  or, when
              run with  job  control
              enabled, any specified
              jobspec  was not found
              or was started without
              job control.

              a readline initializa‐
              tion file such as .in‐

              ing or command must be
              passed as  a  separate
              argument;        e.g.,
              '"\C-x\C-r":
              re-read-init-file'.
              Options, if  supplied,

              -m keymap
                     Use  keymap  as
                     the  keymap  to
                     be affected  by
                     the  subsequent

              The return value is  0
              unless an unrecognized
              option  is given or an

       break [n]
              Exit  from  within   a
              for,  while, until, or
              select loop.  If n  is
              specified,   break   n
              levels.  n must  be  ≥
              1.   If  n  is greater
              than the number of en‐
              closing loops, all en‐
              closing loops are  ex‐
              ited.     The   return
              value is 0 unless n is
              not  greater  than  or
              equal to 1.

       builtin shell-builtin [argu‐
       ments]
              Execute  the specified
              shell builtin, passing
              it arguments, and  re‐
              turn  its exit status.
              This  is  useful  when
              defining   a  function
              whose name is the same
              as  a  shell  builtin,
              retaining   the  func‐
              tionality    of    the
              builtin   within   the
              function.    The    cd
              builtin   is  commonly
              redefined  this   way.
              The  return  status is
              false if shell-builtin
              is not a shell builtin
              command.

       caller [expr]
              Returns the context of
              any active  subroutine
              call (a shell function
              or  a  script executed
              with the .  or  source
              builtins).     Without
              expr, caller  displays
              the  line  number  and
              source filename of the
              current     subroutine
              call.   If a non-nega‐
              tive integer  is  sup‐
              plied  as expr, caller
              displays the line num‐
              ber, subroutine  name,
              and source file corre‐
              sponding to that posi‐
              tion  in  the  current
              execution call  stack.
              This extra information
              may be used, for exam‐
              ple,  to print a stack
              trace.   The   current
              frame is frame 0.  The
              return  value is 0 un‐
              less the shell is  not
              executing a subroutine
              call  or expr does not
              correspond to a  valid
              position  in  the call
              stack.

       cd [-L|[-P [-e]] [-@]] [dir]
              Change the current di‐
              rectory  to  dir.   if
              dir  is  not supplied,
              the value of the  HOME
              shell  variable is the
              default.  The variable
              CDPATH   defines   the
              search  path  for  the
              directory   containing
              dir:   each  directory
              name  in   CDPATH   is
              searched for dir.  Al‐
              ternative    directory
              names  in  CDPATH  are
              separated  by  a colon
              (:).  A null directory
              name in CDPATH is  the
              same  as  the  current
              directory,       i.e.,
              ``.''.   If dir begins
              with a slash (/), then
              CDPATH  is  not  used.
              The  -P  option causes
              cd to use the physical
              directory structure by
              resolving     symbolic
              links while traversing
              dir  and  before  pro‐
              cessing  instances  of
              ..  in  dir  (see also
              the -P option  to  the
              set  builtin command);
              the -L  option  forces
              symbolic  links  to be
              followed by  resolving
              the  link  after  pro‐
              cessing  instances  of
              ..  in dir.  If .. ap‐
              pears in  dir,  it  is
              processed  by removing
              the immediately previ‐
              ous pathname component
              from dir,  back  to  a
              slash or the beginning
              of dir.  If the -e op‐
              tion  is supplied with
              -P,  and  the  current
              working directory can‐
              not   be  successfully
              determined   after   a
              successful   directory
              change, cd will return
              an  unsuccessful  sta‐
              tus.   On systems that
              support it, the -@ op‐
              tion presents the  ex‐
              tended  attributes as‐
              sociated with  a  file
              as  a  directory.   An
              argument of - is  con‐
              verted  to $OLDPWD be‐
              fore   the   directory
              change  is  attempted.
              If a non-empty  direc‐
              tory  name from CDPATH
              is used, or  if  -  is
              the   first  argument,
              and   the    directory
              change  is successful,
              the absolute  pathname
              of the new working di‐

              the  standard  output.
              If    the    directory
              change is  successful,
              cd  sets  the value of
              the  PWD   environment
              variable  to  the  new
              directory  name,   and
              sets  the OLDPWD envi‐
              ronment  variable   to
              the  value of the cur‐
              rent working directory
              before   the   change.
              The  return  value  is
              true if the  directory
              was       successfully
              changed; false  other‐

       command [-pVv] command [arg
       ...]
              Run  command with args
              suppressing the normal
              shell function lookup.
              Only builtin  commands
              or  commands  found in
              the PATH are executed.
              If the  -p  option  is
              given,  the search for
              command  is  performed
              using  a default value
              for PATH that is guar‐
              anteed to find all  of
              the   standard  utili‐
              ties.  If  either  the
              -V  or  -v  option  is
              supplied,  a  descrip‐
              tion   of  command  is
              printed.  The  -v  op‐
              tion  causes  a single
              word  indicating   the
              command   or  filename
              used to invoke command
              to be  displayed;  the
              -V  option  produces a
              more verbose  descrip‐
              tion.  If the -V or -v
              option   is  supplied,
              the exit status  is  0
              if  command was found,
              and 1 if not.  If nei‐
              ther  option  is  sup‐
              plied and an error oc‐
              curred or command can‐
              not be found, the exit
              status is 127.  Other‐
              wise,  the exit status
              of the command builtin
              is the exit status  of
              command.

       compgen [option] [word]
              Generate possible com‐
              pletion   matches  for
              word according to  the
              options,  which may be
              any option accepted by
              the  complete  builtin
              with  the exception of
              -p and -r,  and  write
              the   matches  to  the
              standard output.  When
              using the -F or -C op‐
              tions,   the   various
              shell variables set by
              the  programmable com‐
              pletion    facilities,
              while  available, will
              not have  useful  val‐
              ues.

              The  matches  will  be
              generated in the  same
              way as if the program‐
              mable  completion code
              had generated them di‐
              rectly from a  comple‐
              tion     specification
              with the  same  flags.
              If  word is specified,
              only those completions
              matching word will  be
              displayed.

              The  return  value  is
              true unless an invalid
              option is supplied, or
              no matches were gener‐
              ated.

              to each name should be

              option is supplied, or
              if no options are sup‐
              plied,  existing  com‐
              pletion specifications
              are  printed  in a way
              that allows them to be
              reused as input.   The
              -r  option  removes  a
              completion  specifica‐
              tion  for  each  name,

              supplied,  all comple‐
              tion   specifications.
              The  -D  option  indi‐
              cates that other  sup‐
              plied  options and ac‐
              tions should apply  to
              the  ``default''  com‐
              mand completion;  that
              is,   completion   at‐
              tempted on  a  command
              for  which  no comple‐
              tion  has   previously
              been  defined.  The -E
              option indicates  that
              other supplied options
              and actions should ap‐
              ply  to ``empty'' com‐
              mand completion;  that
              is,   completion   at‐
              tempted  on  a   blank
              line.   The  -I option
              indicates  that  other
              supplied  options  and
              actions  should  apply
              to  completion  on the
              initial non-assignment
              word on the  line,  or
              after a command delim‐
              iter  such  as ; or |,
              which is usually  com‐
              mand  name completion.
              If  multiple   options
              are  supplied,  the -D
              option  takes   prece‐
              dence   over  -E,  and
              both  take  precedence
              over  -I.   If  any of
              -D, -E, or -I are sup‐
              plied, any other  name
              arguments are ignored;
              these completions only
              apply   to   the  case
              specified by  the  op‐

              following    meanings.
              The arguments  to  the

              should  be  quoted  to

              no completion has pre‐
              viously  been defined.
              The  -E  option  indi‐
              cates  that other sup‐
              plied  options  should

              command    completion;
              that   is,  completion
              attempted on  a  blank
              line.   The  -I option
              indicates  that  other
              supplied       options
              should apply  to  com‐
              pletion on the initial

              The  return  value  is

              are given then display
              the  values  of  vari‐
              ables.  The -p  option
              will  display  the at‐
              tributes and values of
              each name.  When -p is
              used with  name  argu‐
              ments,  additional op‐
              tions, other  than  -f
              and  -F,  are ignored.
              When  -p  is  supplied
              without   name   argu‐
              ments, it will display
              the   attributes   and
              values  of  all  vari‐
              ables having  the  at‐
              tributes  specified by
              the   additional   op‐
              tions.   If  no  other
              options  are  supplied
              with  -p, declare will
              display the attributes
              and  values   of   all
              shell  variables.  The
              -f  option  will   re‐
              strict  the display to
              shell functions.   The
              -F option inhibits the
              display   of  function
              definitions; only  the
              function  name and at‐
              tributes are  printed.
              If  the extdebug shell
              option is enabled  us‐

              file  name  and   line
              number where each name
              is  defined  are  dis‐
              played as  well.   The
              -F  option implies -f.
              The -g  option  forces
              variables  to  be cre‐
              ated  or  modified  at
              the global scope, even
              when  declare  is exe‐
              cuted in a shell func‐
              tion.  It  is  ignored
              in  all  other  cases.
              The -I  option  causes
              local variables to in‐
              herit  the  attributes
              (except  the   nameref

              name  from  shared ob‐
              ject filename, on sys‐
              tems that support  dy‐
              namic  loading.   Bash
              will use the value  of
              the         BASH_LOAD‐
              ABLES_PATH variable as
              a colon-separated list
              of   directories    in
              which  to  search  for
              filename.  The default
              is   system-dependent.
              The   -d  option  will
              delete a builtin  pre‐
              viously   loaded  with
              -f.  If no name  argu‐
              ments are given, or if
              the  -p option is sup‐
              plied, a list of shell
              builtins  is  printed.
              With  no  other option
              arguments,  the   list
              consists  of  all  en‐
              abled shell  builtins.
              If   -n  is  supplied,
              only disabled builtins
              are printed.  If -a is
              supplied,   the   list
              printed  includes  all
              builtins, with an  in‐
              dication of whether or
              not  each  is enabled.
              If -s is supplied, the
              output  is  restricted
              to  the  POSIX special
              builtins.  If  no  op‐
              tions are supplied and
              a  name is not a shell
              builtin,  enable  will
              attempt  to  load name
              from a  shared  object
              named  name, as if the
              command were  ``enable
              -f  name  name  .  The
              return value is 0  un‐
              less  a  name is not a
              shell builtin or there
              is an error loading  a
              new   builtin  from  a
              shared object.

       eval [arg ...]
              The args are read  and
              concatenated  together
              into a single command.
              This command  is  then
              read  and  executed by
              the  shell,  and   its
              exit   status  is  re‐
              turned as the value of
              eval.  If there are no
              args, or only null ar‐
              guments, eval  returns
              0.

       exec [-cl] [-a name] [command
       [arguments]]
              If  command  is speci‐
              fied, it replaces  the
              shell.  No new process
              is created.  The argu‐
              ments become the argu‐
              ments  to command.  If
              the -l option is  sup‐
              plied,    the    shell
              places a dash  at  the
              beginning  of  the ze‐
              roth  argument  passed
              to  command.   This is
              what  login(1)   does.
              The  -c  option causes
              command to be executed
              with an empty environ‐
              ment.  If -a  is  sup‐
              plied,    the    shell
              passes name as the ze‐
              roth argument  to  the
              executed  command.  If
              command cannot be exe‐
              cuted for some reason,
              a      non-interactive
              shell   exits,  unless
              the execfail shell op‐
              tion is  enabled.   In
              that  case, it returns
              failure.  An  interac‐
              tive   shell   returns
              failure  if  the  file
              cannot be executed.  A
              subshell  exits uncon‐
              ditionally   if   exec
              fails.   If command is
              not   specified,   any
              redirections  take ef‐
              fect  in  the  current
              shell,  and the return
              status is 0.  If there
              is a  redirection  er‐
              ror, the return status
              is 1.

       exit [n]
              Cause   the  shell  to
              exit with a status  of
              n.   If  n is omitted,
              the  exit  status   is
              that  of the last com‐
              mand executed.  A trap
              on  EXIT  is  executed
              before  the shell ter‐
              minates.

       export [-fn] [name[=word]]
       ...
       export -p
              The supplied names are
              marked  for  automatic
              export to the environ‐
              ment  of  subsequently
              executed commands.  If
              the   -f   option   is
              given, the names refer
              to  functions.   If no
              names are given, or if
              the -p option is  sup‐
              plied, a list of names
              of  all exported vari‐
              ables is printed.  The
              -n option  causes  the
              export  property to be
              removed   from    each
              name.   If  a variable
              name  is  followed  by
              =word,  the  value  of
              the variable is set to
              word.  export  returns
              an  exit  status  of 0
              unless an invalid  op‐
              tion  is  encountered,
              one of  the  names  is
              not   a   valid  shell
              variable name,  or  -f
              is   supplied  with  a
              name  that  is  not  a
              function.

       fc [-e ename] [-lnr] [first]
       [last]
       fc -s [pat=rep] [cmd]
              The first form selects
              a  range  of  commands
              from  first  to   last
              from  the history list
              and displays or  edits
              and  re-executes them.
              First and last may  be
              specified  as a string
              (to  locate  the  last
              command beginning with
              that  string)  or as a
              number (an index  into
              the    history   list,
              where a negative  num‐
              ber is used as an off‐
              set  from  the current
              command number).  When
              listing,  a  first  or
              last  of  0 is equiva‐
              lent to -1 and  -0  is
              equivalent to the cur‐
              rent  command (usually
              the fc command);  oth‐
              erwise 0 is equivalent
              to  -1  and  -0 is in‐
              valid.  If last is not
              specified, it  is  set
              to the current command
              for  listing  (so that
              ``fc -l  -10''  prints
              the  last 10 commands)
              and  to  first  other‐
              wise.  If first is not
              specified,  it  is set
              to the  previous  com‐
              mand  for  editing and
              -16 for listing.

              The  -n  option   sup‐
              presses   the  command
              numbers when  listing.
              The -r option reverses
              the  order of the com‐
              mands.  If the -l  op‐
              tion   is  given,  the
              commands are listed on
              standard output.  Oth‐
              erwise,   the   editor
              given  by ename is in‐
              voked on a  file  con‐
              taining   those   com‐
              mands.   If  ename  is
              not  given,  the value
              of the FCEDIT variable
              is used, and the value
              of EDITOR if FCEDIT is
              not set.   If  neither
              variable is set, vi is
              used.  When editing is
              complete,  the  edited
              commands  are   echoed
              and executed.

              In  the  second  form,
              command is re-executed
              after each instance of
              pat  is  replaced   by
              rep.   Command  is in‐
              terpreted the same  as
              first above.  A useful
              alias to use with this
              is  ``r="fc  -s"'', so
              that typing  ``r  cc''
              runs  the last command
              beginning with  ``cc''
              and  typing  ``r'' re-
              executes the last com‐
              mand.

              If the first  form  is
              used, the return value
              is 0 unless an invalid
              option  is encountered
              or first or last spec‐
              ify history lines  out
              of  range.   If the -e
              option  is   supplied,
              the  return  value  is
              the value of the  last
              command   executed  or
              failure  if  an  error
              occurs with the tempo‐
              rary file of commands.
              If  the second form is
              used, the return  sta‐
              tus  is  that  of  the
              command   re-executed,
              unless  cmd  does  not
              specify a  valid  his‐
              tory  line,  in  which
              case fc returns  fail‐
              ure.

       fg [jobspec]
              Resume  jobspec in the
              foreground,  and  make
              it  the  current  job.
              If  jobspec   is   not
              present,  the  shell's
              notion of the  current
              job  is used.  The re‐
              turn value is that  of
              the   command   placed
              into  the  foreground,
              or failure if run when
              job  control  is  dis‐
              abled  or,  when   run
              with  job  control en‐
              abled, if jobspec does
              not  specify  a  valid
              job  or jobspec speci‐
              fies a  job  that  was
              started   without  job
              control.

       getopts optstring name [arg
       ...]
              getopts  is  used   by
              shell   procedures  to
              parse positional para‐
              meters.      optstring
              contains   the  option
              characters to be  rec‐
              ognized;  if a charac‐
              ter is followed  by  a
              colon,  the  option is
              expected  to  have  an
              argument, which should
              be  separated  from it
              by white  space.   The
              colon   and   question
              mark  characters   may
              not  be used as option
              characters.  Each time
              it is invoked, getopts
              places the next option
              in the shell  variable
              name,     initializing
              name if  it  does  not
              exist,  and  the index
              of the  next  argument
              to  be  processed into
              the  variable  OPTIND.
              OPTIND  is initialized
              to  1  each  time  the
              shell   or   a   shell
              script   is   invoked.
              When   an  option  re‐
              quires  an   argument,
              getopts   places  that
              argument   into    the
              variable  OPTARG.  The
              shell does  not  reset
              OPTIND  automatically;
              it  must  be  manually
              reset between multiple
              calls    to    getopts
              within the same  shell
              invocation  if  a  new
              set of  parameters  is
              to be used.

              When  the  end  of op‐
              tions is  encountered,
              getopts  exits  with a
              return  value  greater
              than  zero.  OPTIND is
              set to  the  index  of
              the  first  non-option
              argument, and name  is
              set to ?.

              getopts       normally
              parses the  positional
              parameters,   but   if
              more   arguments   are
              supplied  as  arg val‐
              ues,  getopts   parses
              those instead.

              getopts can report er‐
              rors  in two ways.  If
              the first character of
              optstring is a  colon,
              silent error reporting
              is  used.   In  normal
              operation,  diagnostic
              messages  are  printed
              when  invalid  options
              or  missing option ar‐
              guments  are   encoun‐
              tered.   If  the vari‐
              able OPTERR is set  to
              0,  no  error messages
              will   be   displayed,
              even   if   the  first
              character of optstring
              is not a colon.

              If an  invalid  option
              is    seen,    getopts
              places  ?  into   name
              and,  if  not  silent,
              prints an  error  mes‐
              sage  and  unsets  OP‐
              TARG.  If  getopts  is
              silent,   the   option
              character   found   is
              placed  in  OPTARG and
              no diagnostic  message
              is printed.

              If a required argument
              is   not   found,  and
              getopts is not silent,
              a question mark (?) is
              placed in name, OPTARG
              is unset, and a  diag‐
              nostic    message   is
              printed.   If  getopts
              is   silent,   then  a
              colon (:) is placed in
              name and OPTARG is set
              to the option  charac‐
              ter found.

              getopts  returns  true
              if an  option,  speci‐
              fied  or  unspecified,
              is found.  It  returns
              false  if  the  end of
              options is encountered
              or an error occurs.

       hash [-lr] [-p filename]
       [-dt] [name]
              Each time hash is  in‐
              voked,  the full path‐
              name  of  the  command
              name  is determined by
              searching the directo‐
              ries in $PATH and  re‐
              membered.   Any previ‐
              ously-remembered path‐
              name is discarded.  If
              the -p option is  sup‐
              plied,  no path search
              is   performed,    and
              filename  is  used  as
              the full  filename  of
              the  command.   The -r
              option   causes    the
              shell  to  forget  all
              remembered  locations.
              The  -d  option causes
              the  shell  to  forget
              the  remembered  loca‐
              tion of each name.  If
              the -t option is  sup‐
              plied,  the full path‐
              name  to  which   each
              name   corresponds  is
              printed.  If  multiple
              name   arguments   are
              supplied with -t,  the
              name is printed before
              the  hashed full path‐
              name.  The  -l  option
              causes  output  to  be
              displayed in a  format
              that  may be reused as
              input.   If  no  argu‐
              ments are given, or if
              only  -l  is supplied,
              information about  re‐
              membered  commands  is
              printed.   The  return
              status  is true unless
              a name is not found or
              an invalid  option  is
              supplied.

              If  filename  is  sup‐

                     the     history

                     before the args
                     are added.

              If  the HISTTIMEFORMAT
              variable is  set,  the
              time stamp information
              associated  with  each
              history entry is writ‐
              ten  to  the   history
              file,  marked with the
              history comment  char‐
              acter.   When the his‐
              tory  file  is   read,
              lines  beginning  with
              the  history   comment
              character followed im‐

       jobs [-lnprs] [ jobspec ... ]
       jobs -x command [ args ... ]
              The  first  form lists
              the active jobs.   The
              options  have the fol‐
              lowing meanings:
              -l     List    process
                     IDs in addition
                     to  the  normal

                     status    since
                     the  user   was
                     last   notified
                     of  their  sta‐
                     tus.
              -p     List  only  the

                     process   group
                     leader.
              -r     Display    only
                     running jobs.
              -s     Display    only
                     stopped jobs.

              If  jobspec  is given,
              output  is  restricted
              to  information  about
              that job.  The  return
              status  is 0 unless an
              invalid option is  en‐
              countered  or  an  in‐
              valid jobspec is  sup‐
              plied.

              If  the  -x  option is
              supplied,   jobs   re‐
              places   any   jobspec
              found  in  command  or
              args  with  the corre‐
              sponding process group
              ID, and executes  com‐
              mand  passing it args,
              returning   its   exit
              status.

       kill [-s sigspec | -n signum
       | -sigspec] [pid | jobspec]
       ...
       kill -l|-L [sigspec |
       exit_status]
              Send  the signal named
              by sigspec  or  signum
              to the processes named
              by   pid  or  jobspec.
              sigspec  is  either  a
              case-insensitive  sig‐
              nal   name   such   as
              SIGKILL (with or with‐
              out the SIG prefix) or
              a    signal    number;
              signum  is  a   signal
              number.  If sigspec is
              not    present,   then
              SIGTERM  is   assumed.
              An   argument   of  -l
              lists    the    signal
              names.   If  any argu‐
              ments   are   supplied
              when  -l is given, the
              names of  the  signals
              corresponding  to  the
              arguments are  listed,
              and  the return status
              is 0.  The exit_status
              argument to  -l  is  a
              number  specifying ei‐
              ther a  signal  number
              or  the exit status of
              a  process  terminated
              by  a  signal.  The -L
              option  is  equivalent
              to  -l.   kill returns
              true if at  least  one
              signal   was  success‐
              fully sent,  or  false
              if  an error occurs or
              an invalid  option  is
              encountered.

       let arg [arg ...]
              Each  arg is an arith‐
              metic expression to be
              evaluated (see  ARITH‐
              METIC       EVALUATION
              above).  If  the  last
              arg  evaluates  to  0,
              let returns  1;  0  is
              returned otherwise.

       local [option] [name[=value]
       ... | - ]
              For  each  argument, a
              local  variable  named
              name  is  created, and
              assigned  value.   The
              option  can  be any of
              the  options  accepted
              by  declare.  When lo‐
              cal is used  within  a
              function,   it  causes
              the variable  name  to
              have  a  visible scope
              restricted   to   that
              function and its chil‐
              dren.   If  name is -,
              the set of  shell  op‐
              tions is made local to
              the  function in which
              local   is    invoked:
              shell  options changed
              using the set  builtin
              inside   the  function
              are restored to  their
              original  values  when
              the function  returns.
              The   restore  is  ef‐
              fected as if a  series
              of  set  commands were
              executed  to   restore
              the  values  that were
              in  place  before  the

              operands, local writes
              a list of local  vari‐
              ables  to the standard
              output.  It is an  er‐
              ror  to use local when
              not within a function.
              The return status is 0
              unless local  is  used
              outside a function, an
              invalid  name  is sup‐
              plied, or  name  is  a

                     each   call  to
                     callback.

              If  -C  is   specified
              without  -c,  the  de‐
              fault quantum is 5000.
              When callback is eval‐
              uated, it is  supplied
              the  index of the next
              array  element  to  be
              assigned  and the line
              to be assigned to that
              element as  additional
              arguments.    callback
              is evaluated after the
              line is read  but  be‐
              fore the array element
              is assigned.

              If  not  supplied with

       popd [-n] [+n] [-n]
              Removes  entries  from
              the  directory  stack.
              The elements are  num‐
              bered  from 0 starting
              at the first directory
              listed by dirs.   With
              no arguments, popd re‐
              moves  the  top direc‐
              tory from  the  stack,
              and changes to the new
              top  directory.  Argu‐
              ments,  if   supplied,
              have   the   following
              meanings:
              -n     Suppresses  the
                     normal   change
                     of    directory
                     when   removing
                     directories
                     from the stack,
                     so  that   only
                     the   stack  is
                     manipulated.
              +n     Removes the nth
                     entry  counting
                     from  the  left
                     of   the   list
                     shown  by dirs,
                     starting   with
                     zero,  from the
                     stack.  For ex‐
                     ample:   ``popd
                     +0''    removes
                     the  first  di‐
                     rectory, ``popd
                     +1''  the  sec‐
                     ond.
              -n     Removes the nth
                     entry  counting
                     from  the right
                     of   the   list
                     shown  by dirs,
                     starting   with
                     zero.   For ex‐
                     ample:   ``popd
                     -0''    removes
                     the last direc‐
                     tory,    ``popd
                     -1''  the  next
                     to last.

              If the top element  of
              the directory stack is
              modified,  and  the -n
              option  was  not  sup‐
              plied,  popd  uses the
              cd builtin  to  change
              to  the  directory  at
              the top of the  stack.
              If  the cd fails, popd
              returns   a   non-zero
              value.

              Otherwise,   popd  re‐
              turns false if an  in‐
              valid  option  is  en‐
              countered, the  direc‐
              tory  stack  is empty,
              or a non-existent  di‐
              rectory stack entry is
              specified.

              If the popd command is
              successful,  bash runs
              dirs to show the final
              contents of the direc‐
              tory  stack,  and  the
              return status is 0.

       printf [-v var] format [argu‐
       ments]
              Write   the  formatted
              arguments to the stan‐
              dard output under  the
              control of the format.
              The  -v  option causes
              the output to  be  as‐
              signed to the variable
              var  rather than being
              printed to  the  stan‐
              dard output.

              The  format is a char‐
              acter   string   which
              contains  three  types
              of   objects:    plain
              characters,  which are
              simply copied to stan‐
              dard output, character
              escape      sequences,
              which   are  converted
              and  copied   to   the
              standard  output,  and
              format specifications,
              each of  which  causes
              printing  of  the next
              successive   argument.
              In   addition  to  the
              standard     printf(1)
              format specifications,
              printf  interprets the
              following extensions:
              %b     causes   printf
                     to expand back‐
                     slash    escape
                     sequences    in
                     the correspond‐
                     ing argument in
                     the same way as
                     echo -e.
              %q     causes   printf
                     to  output  the
                     corresponding
                     argument  in  a
                     format that can
                     be  reused   as
                     shell input.
              %Q     like   %q,  but
                     applies     any
                     supplied preci‐
                     sion to the ar‐
                     gument   before
                     quoting it.
              %(datefmt)T
                     causes   printf
                     to  output  the
                     date-time
                     string  result‐
                     ing  from using
                     datefmt  as   a
                     format   string
                     for       strf‐
                     time(3).    The
                     corresponding
                     argument is  an
                     integer  repre‐
                     senting     the
                     number  of sec‐
                     onds since  the
                     epoch.      Two
                     special   argu‐
                     ment values may
                     be   used:   -1
                     represents  the
                     current   time,
                     and  -2  repre‐
                     sents  the time
                     the  shell  was
                     invoked.  If no
                     argument     is
                     specified, con‐
                     version behaves
                     as  if  -1  had
                     been     given.
                     This is an  ex‐
                     ception  to the
                     usual    printf
                     behavior.

              The %b, %q, and %T di‐
              rectives  all  use the
              field width and preci‐
              sion  arguments   from
              the  format specifica‐
              tion  and  write  that
              many  bytes  from  (or
              use that wide a  field
              for)  the expanded ar‐
              gument, which  usually
              contains  more charac‐
              ters than  the  origi‐
              nal.

              Arguments    to   non-
              string  format  speci‐
              fiers are treated as C
              constants, except that
              a  leading plus or mi‐
              nus sign  is  allowed,
              and   if  the  leading
              character is a  single
              or  double  quote, the
              value  is  the   ASCII
              value of the following
              character.

              The  format  is reused
              as necessary  to  con‐
              sume  all of the argu‐
              ments.  If the  format
              requires   more  argu‐
              ments  than  are  sup‐
              plied,  the extra for‐
              mat specifications be‐
              have  as  if  a   zero
              value  or null string,
              as  appropriate,   had
              been   supplied.   The
              return value  is  zero
              on  success,  non-zero
              on failure.

       pushd [-n] [+n] [-n]
       pushd [-n] [dir]
              Adds  a  directory  to
              the  top of the direc‐
              tory stack, or rotates
              the stack, making  the
              new  top  of the stack
              the  current   working
              directory.    With  no
              arguments,  pushd  ex‐

              elements of the direc‐

              ments,   if  supplied,
              have   the   following
              meanings:
              -n     Suppresses  the
                     normal   change
                     of    directory

                     rectories    to
                     the  stack,  so
                     that  only  the
                     stack is manip‐
                     ulated.
              +n     Rotates     the
                     stack  so  that
                     the  nth direc‐
                     tory  (counting
                     from  the  left
                     of   the   list
                     shown  by dirs,
                     starting   with
                     zero) is at the
                     top.
              -n     Rotates     the
                     stack  so  that

                     from  the right
                     of   the   list
                     shown  by dirs,
                     starting   with

              dir    Adds dir to the
                     directory stack
                     at the top

              After  the  stack  has
              been modified, if  the
              -n option was not sup‐
              plied,  pushd uses the
              cd builtin  to  change
              to  the  directory  at
              the top of the  stack.
              If the cd fails, pushd
              returns   a   non-zero
              value.

              Otherwise, if no argu‐
              ments  are   supplied,
              pushd returns 0 unless
              the directory stack is
              empty.   When rotating
              the  directory  stack,
              pushd returns 0 unless
              the directory stack is
              empty  or  a non-exis‐
              tent  directory  stack
              element is specified.

              If  the  pushd command
              is  successful,   bash
              runs  dirs to show the
              final contents of  the
              directory stack.

       pwd [-LP]
              Print   the   absolute
              pathname of  the  cur‐
              rent   working  direc‐
              tory.   The   pathname
              printed   contains  no
              symbolic links if  the
              -P  option is supplied
              or the -o physical op‐
              tion   to   the    set

              pathname  printed  may
              contain       symbolic
              links.    The   return
              status is 0 unless  an
              error   occurs   while
              reading  the  name  of
              the  current directory
              or an  invalid  option
              is supplied.

       [-N nchars] [-p prompt] [-t
       timeout] [-u fd] [name ...]
              One  line is read from
              the standard input, or
              from the file descrip‐
              tor fd supplied as  an
              argument to the -u op‐

              as described above un‐
              der   Word  Splitting,
              and the first word  is
              assigned  to the first
              name, the second  word
              to  the  second  name,
              and so on.   If  there
              are  more  words  than
              names,  the  remaining
              words and their inter‐
              vening  delimiters are
              assigned to  the  last
              name.   If  there  are
              fewer words read  from
              the  input stream than
              names,  the  remaining
              names   are   assigned
              empty   values.    The
              characters  in IFS are
              used to split the line
              into words  using  the
              same  rules  the shell
              uses   for   expansion
              (described above under
              Word  Splitting).  The
              backslash    character
              (\) may be used to re‐
              move any special mean‐
              ing for the next char‐
              acter   read  and  for
              line     continuation.
              Options,  if supplied,
              have   the   following
              meanings:
              -a aname
                     The  words  are
                     assigned to se‐
                     quential    in‐
                     dices   of  the
                     array  variable
                     aname, starting
                     at 0.  aname is
                     unset    before
                     any new  values
                     are   assigned.
                     Other name  ar‐
                     guments are ig‐
                     nored.
              -d delim
                     The first char‐
                     acter  of delim
                     is used to ter‐
                     minate the  in‐
                     put       line,
                     rather     than
                     newline.     If
                     delim  is   the
                     empty   string,
                     read will  ter‐
                     minate  a  line
                     when it reads a
                     NUL character.
              -e     If the standard
                     input is coming
                     from  a  termi‐

                     (see   READLINE

                     to  obtain  the
                     line.  Readline

                     If  readline is
                     being  used  to
                     read  the line,
                     text is  placed
                     into  the edit‐

              If  no  names are sup‐

              unmodified,   is   as‐
              signed to the variable
              REPLY.   The exit sta‐
              tus  is  zero,  unless
              end-of-file is encoun‐
              tered,  read times out
              (in  which  case   the

              signment  error  (such
              as   assigning   to  a
              readonly variable) oc‐
              curs,  or  an  invalid
              file   descriptor   is
              supplied as the  argu‐
              ment to -u.

       readonly [-aAf] [-p]
       [name[=word] ...]
              The  given  names  are
              marked  readonly;  the
              values  of these names
              may not be changed  by
              subsequent assignment.
              If  the  -f  option is
              supplied,  the   func‐
              tions corresponding to
              the   names   are   so
              marked.  The -a option
              restricts  the   vari‐
              ables  to  indexed ar‐
              rays;  the  -A  option
              restricts   the  vari‐
              ables  to  associative
              arrays.   If  both op‐
              tions are supplied, -A
              takes precedence.   If
              no  name arguments are
              given, or  if  the  -p
              option  is supplied, a
              list of  all  readonly
              names is printed.  The
              other  options  may be
              used to  restrict  the
              output  to a subset of
              the  set  of  readonly
              names.   The -p option
              causes  output  to  be
              displayed  in a format
              that may be reused  as
              input.   If a variable
              name  is  followed  by
              =word,  the  value  of
              the variable is set to
              word.  The return sta‐
              tus is 0 unless an in‐
              valid  option  is  en‐
              countered,  one of the
              names is not  a  valid
              shell  variable  name,
              or -f is supplied with
              a name that is  not  a
              function.

       return [n]
              Causes  a  function to
              stop executing and re‐
              turn the value  speci‐
              fied   by   n  to  its
              caller.  If n is omit‐
              ted, the return status
              is that  of  the  last
              command   executed  in
              the function body.  If
              return is executed  by
              a  trap  handler,  the
              last command  used  to
              determine  the  status
              is  the  last  command
              executed   before  the
              trap handler.  If  re‐
              turn  is executed dur‐
              ing a DEBUG trap,  the
              last  command  used to
              determine  the  status
              is  the  last  command
              executed by  the  trap
              handler  before return
              was invoked.   If  re‐
              turn is used outside a
              function,  but  during
              execution of a  script
              by   the  .   (source)
              command, it causes the
              shell to stop  execut‐
              ing  that  script  and
              return either n or the
              exit  status  of   the
              last  command executed
              within the  script  as
              the exit status of the
              script.   If n is sup‐
              plied,   the    return
              value   is  its  least
              significant  8   bits.
              The  return  status is
              non-zero if return  is
              supplied a non-numeric
              argument,  or  is used
              outside a function and
              not  during  execution
              of  a  script  by . or
              source.   Any  command
              associated   with  the
              RETURN  trap  is  exe‐
              cuted before execution
              resumes    after   the
              function or script.

              The  output  is sorted

              set; if  optnames  are
              supplied,  the  output
              is restricted to those
              options.  The  -p  op‐
              tion  causes output to
              be displayed in a form
              that may be reused  as
              input.   Other options
              have   the   following
              meanings:
              -s     Enable    (set)
                     each optname.
              -u     Disable (unset)
                     each optname.
              -q     Suppresses nor‐
                     mal      output
                     (quiet   mode);
                     the return sta‐
                     tus   indicates
                     whether     the
                     optname is  set
                     or  unset.   If
                     multiple   opt‐
                     name  arguments
                     are given  with
                     -q,  the return
                     status is  zero
                     if all optnames
                     are    enabled;
                     non-zero other‐
                     wise.
              -o     Restricts   the
                     values  of opt‐
                     name   to    be
                     those   defined
                     for the -o  op‐
                     tion to the set
                     builtin.

              If  either -s or -u is
              used with  no  optname
              arguments, shopt shows
              only   those   options
              which are set  or  un‐
              set,     respectively.
              Unless       otherwise
              noted,  the  shopt op‐
              tions   are   disabled
              (unset) by default.

              The return status when
              listing   options   is
              zero if  all  optnames
              are  enabled, non-zero
              otherwise.  When  set‐
              ting  or unsetting op‐
              tions, the return sta‐
              tus is zero unless  an
              optname is not a valid
              shell option.

       [ expr ]
              Return a status  of  0
              (true)  or  1  (false)
              depending on the eval‐
              uation of  the  condi‐
              tional      expression
              expr.   Each  operator
              and  operand must be a
              separate     argument.
              Expressions  are  com‐
              posed of the primaries
              described above  under
              CONDITIONAL    EXPRES‐
              SIONS.  test does  not
              accept   any  options,
              nor does it accept and
              ignore an argument  of
              --  as  signifying the
              end of options.

              Expressions   may   be
              combined   using   the
              following   operators,
              listed  in  decreasing
              order  of  precedence.
              The evaluation depends
              on the number of argu‐
              ments; see below.  Op‐
              erator  precedence  is
              used  when  there  are
              five   or  more  argu‐
              ments.
              ! expr True if expr is
                     false.

                     Returns     the
                     value  of expr.
                     This   may   be
                     used  to  over‐
                     ride the normal

       trap [-lp] [[arg] sigspec
       ...]
              The command arg is  to
              be  read  and executed
              when  the  shell   re‐
              ceives       signal(s)
              sigspec.   If  arg  is
              absent (and there is a
              single  sigspec) or -,
              each specified  signal
              is reset to its origi‐
              nal  disposition  (the
              value it had upon  en‐
              trance  to the shell).
              If  arg  is  the  null
              string    the   signal
              specified   by    each
              sigspec  is ignored by
              the shell and  by  the
              commands  it  invokes.
              If arg is not  present
              and  -p  has been sup‐
              plied, then  the  trap
              commands    associated
              with each sigspec  are
              displayed.   If no ar‐
              guments  are  supplied
              or   if   only  -p  is
              given, trap prints the
              list of commands asso‐
              ciated with each  sig‐
              nal.   The  -l  option
              causes  the  shell  to
              print a list of signal
              names and their corre‐
              sponding      numbers.
              Each sigspec is either
              a signal name  defined
              in  <signal.h>,  or  a
              signal number.  Signal
              names are case  insen‐
              sitive   and  the  SIG
              prefix is optional.

              If a sigspec  is  EXIT
              (0) the command arg is
              executed  on exit from
              the   shell.    If   a
              sigspec  is DEBUG, the
              command  arg  is  exe‐
              cuted   before   every
              simple  command,   for
              command, case command,
              select  command, every
              arithmetic  for   com‐
              mand,  and  before the
              first command executes
              in  a  shell  function
              (see   SHELL   GRAMMAR
              above).  Refer to  the
              description   of   the
              extdebug option to the
              shopt builtin for  de‐
              tails of its effect on
              the  DEBUG trap.  If a
              sigspec is RETURN, the
              command  arg  is  exe‐
              cuted   each   time  a
              shell  function  or  a
              script  executed  with
              the   .   or    source
              builtins finishes exe‐
              cuting.

              If  a  sigspec is ERR,
              the command arg is ex‐
              ecuted   whenever    a
              pipeline   (which  may
              consist  of  a  single
              simple   command),   a
              list,  or  a  compound
              command    returns   a
              non-zero exit  status,
              subject to the follow‐
              ing  conditions.   The
              ERR trap is  not  exe‐
              cuted  if  the  failed
              command is part of the
              command  list  immedi‐
              ately    following   a
              while  or  until  key‐
              word, part of the test
              in  an  if  statement,
              part of a command exe‐
              cuted in a  &&  or  ||
              list  except  the com‐
              mand following the fi‐
              nal && or ||, any com‐
              mand in a pipeline but
              the last,  or  if  the
              command's return value
              is  being inverted us‐
              ing !.  These are  the
              same conditions obeyed
              by  the  errexit  (-e)
              option.

              Signals  ignored  upon
              entry   to  the  shell
              cannot be  trapped  or
              reset.   Trapped  sig‐
              nals that are not  be‐
              ing  ignored are reset
              to their original val‐
              ues in a  subshell  or
              subshell   environment
              when one  is  created.
              The  return  status is
              false if  any  sigspec
              is  invalid; otherwise
              trap returns true.

       type [-aftpP] name [name ...]
              With no options, indi‐
              cate  how  each   name
              would  be  interpreted
              if used as  a  command
              name.   If  the -t op‐
              tion  is  used,   type
              prints  a string which
              is one of alias,  key‐
              word,        function,
              builtin,  or  file  if
              name   is   an  alias,
              shell  reserved  word,
              function,  builtin, or
              disk   file,   respec‐
              tively.   If  the name
              is  not  found,   then
              nothing   is  printed,
              and an exit status  of
              false is returned.  If
              the -p option is used,
              type   either  returns
              the name of  the  disk
              file that would be ex‐
              ecuted  if  name  were
              specified as a command
              name,  or  nothing  if
              ``type -t name'' would
              not  return file.  The
              -P  option  forces   a
              PATH  search  for each
              name, even  if  ``type
              -t  name''  would  not
              return  file.   If   a
              command  is hashed, -p
              and   -P   print   the
              hashed value, which is
              not   necessarily  the
              file   that    appears
              first in PATH.  If the
              -a   option  is  used,
              type prints all of the
              places that contain an
              executable named name.
              This includes  aliases
              and  functions, if and
              only if the -p  option
              is not also used.  The
              table  of  hashed com‐
              mands is not consulted
              when using -a.  The -f
              option      suppresses
              shell function lookup,
              as  with  the  command
              builtin.  type returns
              true if all of the ar‐
              guments   are   found,
              false  if  any are not
              found.

       ulimit [-HS] -a
       ulimit [-HS] [-bcdefiklmn‐
       pqrstuvxPRT [limit]]
              Provides control  over
              the  resources  avail‐
              able to the shell  and
              to  processes  started
              by it, on systems that
              allow  such   control.
              The  -H and -S options
              specify that the  hard
              or  soft  limit is set
              for  the   given   re‐
              source.   A hard limit
              cannot be increased by
              a non-root  user  once
              it   is  set;  a  soft
              limit may be increased
              up to the value of the
              hard limit.   If  nei‐
              ther   -H  nor  -S  is
              specified,  both   the
              soft  and  hard limits
              are set.  The value of
              limit can be a  number
              in  the unit specified
              for  the  resource  or
              one   of  the  special
              values hard, soft,  or
              unlimited, which stand
              for  the  current hard
              limit,   the   current
              soft   limit,  and  no
              limit,   respectively.
              If  limit  is omitted,
              the current  value  of
              the  soft limit of the
              resource  is  printed,
              unless  the  -H option
              is given.   When  more
              than  one  resource is
              specified,  the  limit
              name  and unit, if ap‐
              propriate, are printed
              before   the    value.

              terpreted as follows:

                     number       of
                     threads

              If limit is given, and
              the -a option  is  not
              used, limit is the new
              value of the specified
              resource.   If  no op‐
              tion is given, then -f
              is  assumed.    Values
              are  in  1024-byte in‐
              crements,  except  for
              -t,  which  is in sec‐
              onds; -R, which is  in
              microseconds;      -p,
              which is in  units  of
              512-byte  blocks;  -P,
              -T, -b,  -k,  -n,  and
              -u, which are unscaled
              values;  and,  when in
              posix mode, -c and -f,
              which are in  512-byte

              or  argument  is  sup‐
              plied, or an error oc‐
              curs while  setting  a
              new limit.

       umask [-p] [-S] [mode]
              The user file-creation
              mask  is  set to mode.
              If mode begins with  a
              digit,  it  is  inter‐
              preted  as  an   octal
              number;  otherwise  it
              is  interpreted  as  a
              symbolic   mode   mask
              similar  to  that  ac‐
              cepted   by  chmod(1).
              If  mode  is  omitted,
              the  current  value of
              the mask  is  printed.
              The  -S  option causes
              the mask to be printed
              in symbolic form;  the
              default  output  is an
              octal number.  If  the
              -p option is supplied,
              and  mode  is omitted,
              the  output  is  in  a
              form   that   may   be
              reused as input.   The
              return  status is 0 if
              the mode was  success‐
              fully changed or if no
              mode argument was sup‐
              plied,  and false oth‐
              erwise.

       unalias [-a] [name ...]
              Remove each name  from
              the  list  of  defined
              aliases.   If  -a   is
              supplied,   all  alias
              definitions  are   re‐
              moved.    The   return
              value is true unless a
              supplied name is not a
              defined alias.

       unset [-fv] [-n] [name ...]
              For each name,  remove
              the      corresponding
              variable or  function.
              If  the  -v  option is
              given,    each    name
              refers   to   a  shell
              variable,   and   that
              variable  is  removed.
              Read-only    variables
              may  not be unset.  If
              -f is specified,  each
              name refers to a shell
              function,    and   the
              function definition is
              removed.   If  the  -n
              option   is  supplied,
              and name is a variable
              with the  nameref  at‐
              tribute,  name will be
              unset rather than  the
              variable   it   refer‐
              ences.  -n has no  ef‐
              fect  if the -f option
              is  supplied.   If  no
              options  are supplied,
              each name refers to  a
              variable;  if there is
              no  variable  by  that
              name,  a function with
              that name, if any,  is
              unset.    Each   unset
              variable  or  function
              is  removed  from  the
              environment passed  to
              subsequent   commands.

              properties,   even  if
              they are  subsequently
              reset.   The exit sta‐
              tus is true  unless  a
              name  is  readonly  or
              may not be unset.

       wait [-fn] [-p varname] [id
       ...]
              Wait for  each  speci‐
              fied child process and
              return its termination
              status.   Each  id may
              be a process ID  or  a
              job  specification; if
              a job spec  is  given,
              all  processes in that
              job's   pipeline   are
              waited  for.  If id is
              not given, wait  waits
              for  all running back‐
              ground  jobs  and  the
              last-executed  process
              substitution,  if  its
              process id is the same
              as  $!, and the return
              status  is  zero.   If
              the  -n option is sup‐
              plied, wait waits  for
              a  single job from the
              list of ids or, if  no
              ids  are supplied, any
              job, to  complete  and
              returns  its exit sta‐
              tus.  If none  of  the
              supplied  arguments is
              a child of the  shell,
              or if no arguments are
              supplied and the shell
              has   no  unwaited-for
              children,   the   exit
              status is 127.  If the
              -p option is supplied,
              the   process  or  job
              identifier of the  job
              for   which  the  exit
              status is returned  is
              assigned  to the vari‐
              able varname named  by
              the  option  argument.
              The variable  will  be
              unset  initially,  be‐
              fore  any  assignment.
              This  is  useful  only
              when the -n option  is
              supplied.    Supplying
              the  -f  option,  when
              job   control  is  en‐
              abled, forces wait  to
              wait  for id to termi‐
              nate before  returning
              its status, instead of
              returning    when   it
              changes status.  If id
              specifies a  non-exis‐
              tent  process  or job,
              the return  status  is
              127.   If  wait is in‐
              terrupted by a signal,
              the return status will
              be greater  than  128,
              as   described   under
              SIGNALS above.  Other‐
              wise, the return  sta‐
              tus is the exit status
              of the last process or
              job waited for.

SHELL COMPATIBILITY MODE
       Bash-4.0  introduced the con‐
       cept of a shell compatibility
       level, specified as a set  of
       options  to the shopt builtin
       (  compat31,  compat32,  com‐
       pat40,  compat41, and so on).
       There  is  only  one  current
       compatibility  level  -- each
       option is mutually exclusive.
       The  compatibility  level  is
       intended  to  allow  users to
       select behavior from previous
       versions that is incompatible
       with  newer  versions   while
       they  migrate  scripts to use
       current features  and  behav‐
       ior.  It's  intended  to be a
       temporary solution.

       This section does not mention
       behavior that is standard for
       a particular  version  (e.g.,
       setting  compat32  means that
       quoting the rhs of the regexp
       matching operator quotes spe‐
       cial regexp characters in the
       word, which is default behav‐
       ior in  bash-3.2  and  subse‐
       quent versions).

       If  a user enables, say, com‐
       pat32, it may affect the  be‐
       havior of other compatibility
       levels  up  to  and including
       the   current   compatibility
       level.  The idea is that each
       compatibility  level controls
       behavior that changed in that
       version of bash, but that be‐
       havior may have been  present
       in earlier versions.  For in‐
       stance, the change to use lo‐
       cale-based  comparisons  with
       the  [[   command   came   in
       bash-4.1,  and  earlier  ver‐
       sions used  ASCII-based  com‐
       parisons,  so  enabling  com‐
       pat32 will enable ASCII-based
       comparisons  as  well.   That
       granularity may not be suffi‐
       cient  for all uses, and as a
       result  users  should  employ
       compatibility   levels  care‐
       fully.  Read  the  documenta‐
       tion for a particular feature
       to  find  out the current be‐
       havior.

       Bash-4.3  introduced  a   new
       shell  variable: BASH_COMPAT.
       The value  assigned  to  this
       variable  (a  decimal version
       number like 4.2, or an  inte‐
       ger corresponding to the com‐
       patNN option, like 42) deter‐
       mines    the    compatibility
       level.

       Starting with bash-4.4,  Bash
       has  begun  deprecating older
       compatibility levels.   Even‐
       tually,  the  options will be
       removed in favor of BASH_COM‐
       PAT.

       Bash-5.0 is the final version
       for which there  will  be  an
       individual  shopt  option for
       the previous  version.  Users
       should   use  BASH_COMPAT  on
       bash-5.0 and later versions.

       The following table describes
       the  behavior  changes   con‐
       trolled by each compatibility
       level  setting.  The compatNN
       tag is used as shorthand  for
       setting   the   compatibility
       level to NN using one of  the
       following   mechanisms.   For
       versions prior  to  bash-5.0,
       the  compatibility  level may
       be set using the  correspond‐
       ing  compatNN  shopt  option.
       For bash-4.3 and  later  ver‐
       sions,  the BASH_COMPAT vari‐
       able is preferred, and it  is
       required   for  bash-5.1  and
       later versions.

RESTRICTED SHELL
       If bash is started  with  the
       name  rbash, or the -r option
       is  supplied  at  invocation,
       the shell becomes restricted.
       A restricted shell is used to
       set  up  an  environment more
       controlled than the  standard
       shell.   It  behaves  identi‐
       cally to bash with the excep‐
       tion that the  following  are
       disallowed or not performed:

       •      changing   directories
              with cd

       •      setting  or  unsetting
              the  values  of SHELL,
              PATH,  HISTFILE,  ENV,
              or BASH_ENV

       •      specifying     command
              names containing /

       •      specifying a  filename
              containing  a  / as an
              argument  to   the   .
              builtin command

       •      specifying  a filename
              containing a slash  as
              an   argument  to  the
              history  builtin  com‐
              mand

       •      specifying  a filename
              containing a slash  as
              an  argument to the -p
              option  to  the   hash
              builtin command

       •      importing function de‐
              finitions   from   the
              shell  environment  at
              startup

       •      parsing  the  value of
              SHELLOPTS   from   the
              shell  environment  at
              startup

       •      redirecting output us‐
              ing the >, >|, <>, >&,
              &>, and >> redirection
              operators

       •      using the exec builtin
              command to replace the
              shell   with   another
              command

       •      adding   or   deleting
              builtin commands  with
              the  -f and -d options
              to the enable  builtin
              command

       •      using    the    enable
              builtin command to en‐
              able  disabled   shell
              builtins

       •      specifying  the -p op‐
              tion  to  the  command
              builtin command

       •      turning off restricted
              mode  with  set  +r or
              shopt      -u      re‐
              stricted_shell.

       These  restrictions  are  en‐
       forced  after   any   startup
       files are read.

       When  a command that is found
       to be a shell script is  exe‐
       cuted  (see COMMAND EXECUTION
       above), rbash turns  off  any
       restrictions   in  the  shell
       spawned   to   execute    the
       script.

BUG REPORTS
       If  you  find  a bug in bash,
       you should  report  it.   But
       first,  you  should make sure
       that it really is a bug,  and
       that it appears in the latest
       version  of bash.  The latest
       version is  always  available
       from
       ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/bash/
       and         http://git.savan‐
       nah.gnu.org/cgit/bash.git/snap‐
       shot/bash-master.tar.gz.

       Once you have determined that
       a bug  actually  exists,  use
       the bashbug command to submit
       a  bug report.  If you have a
       fix, you  are  encouraged  to
       mail  that  as well!  Sugges‐
       tions and `philosophical' bug
       reports may be mailed to bug-
       bash@gnu.org or posted to the
       Usenet              newsgroup
       gnu.bash.bug.

       ALL  bug  reports  should in‐
       clude:

       The version number of bash
       The hardware and operating
       system
       The compiler used to compile
       A description of the bug be‐
       haviour
       A short script or `recipe'
       which exercises the bug

       bashbug  inserts  the   first
       three   items   automatically
       into the template it provides
       for filing a bug report.

       Comments and bug reports con‐
       cerning  this   manual   page
       should    be    directed   to
       chet.ramey@case.edu.

BUGS
       It's too big and too slow.

       There are some subtle differ‐
       ences between bash and tradi‐
       tional versions of sh, mostly
       because of the POSIX specifi‐
       cation.

       Aliases are confusing in some
       uses.

       Shell  builtin  commands  and
       functions   are   not   stop‐
       pable/restartable.

       Compound commands and command
       sequences of the form `a ;  b
       ;  c'  are not handled grace‐
       fully when process suspension
       is attempted.  When a process
       is stopped, the shell immedi‐
       ately executes the next  com‐
       mand  in  the  sequence.   It
       suffices  to  place  the  se‐
       quence  of  commands  between
       parentheses to force it  into
       a   subshell,  which  may  be
       stopped as a unit.

       Array variables may not (yet)
       be exported.

       There may be only one  active
       coprocess at a time.
